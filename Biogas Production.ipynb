    "## Introduction\n",
    "One major section of the UASB design is production of biogas, a mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases produced from anaerobic bacteria within the bed.  This biogas can be burned, similar to natural gas and used for heating, evergy production, or cooking.  One goal of the UASB design is to maximize biogas production, and provide an easy system to store, access, and use the biogas in small scale communities. These calculations serve to characterize the production of this biogas, and calculate the necessary parameters for our gas capture lid.  "
