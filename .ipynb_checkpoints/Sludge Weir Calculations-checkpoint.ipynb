    "## Introduction\n",
    "Over the length of operation, anaerobes within a UASB reactor will continue to grow creating excess sludge.  In order to maintain high effluent quality and prevent unintentional discharge of biomass, it is crucial to maintain the sludge blanket height of the UASB.  In conventional UASB reactors, the height of the sludge blanket is maintained manually by discharge through multiple sampling ports on the side of the reactor.  To improve maintanence and create a operator-friendly system,  a sludge weir, based on designs of the AguaClara 1 L/s plant, will be utilized.  This document serves to calculate the size of the sludge weir required and the time required between maintenance."

    "## Qualitative Method\n",
    "The sludge weir is not a critical component of the UASB reactor.  It is simply used to allow for excess microbial growth to be easily controled and monitored based on the floc hopper concept used in AguaClara's 1 L/s sedimentation tank design.  The design of the sludge weir, therefore, does not need to be precisely calculated as it is not essential to the overall treatment provided by the UASB reactor.  While it would be ideal to conduct precisely determine the volume required of the sludge weir to collect X number of days of growth, it is not essential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, the sludge weir will be placed in manner in which the bottom of the entrance will be at the top of the sludge bed to control growth.  A valve will be used to close the sludge weir when maintence and cleaning is required.  The construction of the sludge weir will be similar to that of the 1 L/s plant as fabrication techniques have been well documented.  Once fabrication and pilot testing occur, specific methods of maintenance will be studied."
