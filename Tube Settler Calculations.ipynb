    "## Introduction\n",
    "The tube settler is an integral part of the UASB team's additions to a traditional UASB. The tube settler is modeled after the plate settlers in a sedimentation tank. This design addition will increase the overall solids retention time in the reactor body and improve the effluent quality by allowing particles that leave the body of the reactor time to settle back down. The calculations below determine the design parameters required for the tube settler. \n"
