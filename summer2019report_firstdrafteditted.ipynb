        "Since the spring of 2017, the AguaClara Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) team has been working on a the design and fabrication of a pilot-scale UASB reactor. An UASB reactor is a form of primary wastewater treatment that uses anaerobic digestion to treat the wastewater. The team has created Python code and various CAD models to record the design process and the calculations behind the reactor. In the summer of 2019, the team will be fabricating six UASB reactors at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility for testing and data collection.\n"

        "## Introduction\n",
        "The organization AguaClara was founded in 2004 to focus on providing sustainable, affordable drinking water treatment in the Global South. However, the team noticed many of the communities they were serving were also in need of wastewater treatment. Traditional wastewater treatment in the United States require lots of land, long start-up times, and are expensive to build in run. This technology is not feasible for small, rural communities. Also, many wastewater treatment technologies can be prone to failure, making communities reluctant to invest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The team realized an UASB reactor could be a less expensive and sustainable way to treat wastewater in these communities. It can also be made to be gravity-powered and therefore require no electricity to run. With this in mind, the team started to work on designing an UASB reactor.\n",

        "## Literature Review and Previous Work\n",
        "According to [US Geological Survey](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wuww.html) (USGS), wastewater is any kind of water used by humans. This used water may include dissolved fecal and urine matter, harmful chemicals, pathogens, and many more pollutants. Because it is full of contaminants, it's not longer safe for use. Since water is a universal solvent, it becomes difficult to separate the water from these harmful compounds. These compounds come from a variety of sources such as household wastes from toilets, sinks, baths, and drains or from factories, farming, schools, and urban runoff. As a result, billions of gallons of wastewater are produced and yet many areas in the world still lack access to wastewater treatment plants, thus making wastewater a global issue. Leaving wastewater untreated and releasing it directly back into the environment can produce devastating effects on both the environment and human health.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wastewater can also contain decaying organic matter and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which can cause eutrophication, a term for excess nutrients. Eutrophication then causes algae blooms, leading to oxygen-deprived conditions once the large amount of algae dies off and begins to decompose. This negatively impacts the ecosystem because the lack of oxygen makes it harder for aquatic life to survive. At high concentrations, these water pollutants and organic matter are killing marine birds, crustaceans, sea weeds, and many other organisms. Having too much nitrogen in water can also be dangerous for humans because it can cause methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome) by preventing normal uptake of oxygen in the blood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Human health is also directly affected by a lack of wastewater treatment. Much of untreated wastewater eventually ends up in our rivers, streams, and sometimes ground water. It is often assumed that groundwater is pure and clean; however, it is possible for groundwater to be contaminated by wastewater seeping into the ground. ([Catherine Taylor & Joseph Yahner, 1996](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~frankenb/NU-prowd/disease.htm)). When wastewater reaches drinking water sources, it can pose significant health risks for the community. Pathogens in wastewater destroy crop production, infecting the food supply, and cause water-borne diseases. Some of the many bacteria, viruses, and parasites present in wastewater include: cholera, typhoid, giardiasis and  cryptosporidiosis. ([Catherine Taylor & Joseph Yahner, 1996](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~frankenb/NU-prowd/disease.htm)). Health risks associated with wastewater includes respiratory disease, cancer, diarrheal disease, a neurological disorder, and cardiovascular disease ([Mehtab Haseena, 2017](http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/water-pollution-and-human-health-7925.html)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the biggest issues that wastewater treatment plants face today are energy consumption and environmental footprints. Wastewater facilities typically have treatment processes that include preliminary treatment, sedimentation, chlorination, and processing sludge which are all electrically and fuel powered ([AOS, 2018](https://aosts.com/how-much-energy-does-wastewater-treatment-plant-use/)). In 2018, there were about 14,748 wastewater treatment plants in the US and electricity accounts for 90-95% of the total energy consumed at these facilities while the rest is accounted by fuels such as oil or natural gas. ([University of Michigan, 2019](http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-wastewater-treatment-factsheet)). Wastewater Treatment plants end up using up about 3% of the nation’s total energy consumption ([MGOe, 2019](https://www.mge.com/saving-energy/business/bea/article_detail.htm?nid=%202431)). However, not all countries have access or can afford the same resources such as money, infrastructure, materials, and technology, which makes having universal wastewater treatment plants not feasible in many parts of the world, especially more rural and less developed areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional UASB reactors are used as a preliminary wastewater treatment process to remove suspended solids organic matter in wastewater (Chong et. al, 2012). UASB reactors, instead of using fuel or electricity, rely mainly on gravity and biological processes to remove organic matter and convert it to biogas. UASB stands for Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket and a UASB reactor is a single tank process where wastewater enters the reactor and flows upward through a suspended sludge blanket. This suspended sludge blanket is made up of cultures of anaerobic microorganisms that filters and cleans wastewater by removing organic contaminants and pathogens. UASB reactors are highly efficient in treating high COD loads, biogas formation, and provide good stabilization of solids ([M.K. Daud, 2018](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2018/1596319/)).They are less energy intensive than other forms of preliminary wastewater treatment that use aerobic processes. UASB reactors also produce methane as a byproduct of anaerobic digestion which can be captured and used for energy production or heating. However, these UASB reactors still rely on electricity.\n",
        "\n",
        "AguaClara, on the other hand, has designed a UASB reactor that solely relies on gravity. Its main function is to improve the accessibility and affordability of wastewater treatment for smaller communities that don’t have access to electricity. In January 2017, this gravity-powered UASB reactor was designed for the EPA People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) Student Design Competition proposal. The proposed UASB reactor design focused on improving reactor design, making the system cheaper and easier to fabricate so that it could be created globally. The team later applied for Phase II funding from the same organization to support the development and implementation of additional reactors for testing and received a grant of $75,000."

        "## Timeline of UASB\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summer 2016\n",
        "The UASB team was formed in the Summer of 2016. At that point, the objective of the team was to design and implement a functional lab-scale UASB reactor to treat synthetic blackwater. Blackwater is wastewater from toilets; synthetic blackwater is a mixture of proteins, lipids and starches mixed together (usually with a few other chemicals as well; recipes for synthetic wastewater vary) In the summer of 2016, the UASB team constructed four small-scale UASB reactors and found that those small-scale reactors could successfully treat synthetic wastewater. The team also found that increased wastewater concentration and higher residence times resulted in higher biogas removal and increased Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Fall 2016\n",
        "In the fall of 2016, the UASB team underwent several changes. First, the team altered the design of the small-scale UASB reactors by implementing shorter and narrower influent lines. The team also changed the synthetic wastewater recipe. More specifically, the team substituted glucose with insoluble carbon compounds. The team also researched retention time in the reactors with fluoride tracer tests, and found a HRT of 3.22 hours in one of the reactors (close to the target of 4 hours).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Spring 2017\n",
        "During the spring of 2017, the team worked on assessing the efficiency of two modifications to the UASB reactor: plate settlers and the submerged gas collection lid. After conducting granule settling tests, the team was unable to conclude whether or not plate settlers significantly improve solid retention time. The team also conducted a Submerged Gas Capture Lid Test and concluded that a check valve would be useful to allow for continuous collection into a gas tank without the loss of biogas.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summer 2017\n",
        "In the summer of 2017, the UASB team continued with similar research and testing to that of the Spring 2017 semester. This time, the team determined that large, bulky plate settlers were not required for a full scale reactor. Instead, a smaller settling apparatus, such as a sloped exit weir, can achieve similar sludge retention time(SRT).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Fall 2017\n",
        "During the fall of 2017, the UASB team made several strides. Firstly, the team settled on the critical design assumptions for the fabrication of a UASB reactor at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility (IAWWTF). The critical design assumptions were as follows: a reactor diameter of 3 feet, a reactor height of 7 feet, a 4 hour hydraulic residence time, and a flow rate of .036 L/s. The  team also designed a biogas capture lid. In this system, as biogas is produced in the reactor, it displaces water out from under the lid. Gas is then stored there until it is manually removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The team also wrote Python calculations in Jupyter notebook (available on GitHub) to estimate biogas production based on COD input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the team decided to add plate settlers back to the effluent tube. Plate settlers are intended to prevent dislodged granules from escaping the reactor. The fall 2017 team also worked on designing a sludge weir for the UASB reactor.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Spring 2018\n",
        "UASB continued efforts to improve the design of the pilot-scale UASB reactor in Spring 2018. A major area of focus was the influent flow system. After extensive research, the team chose top influent flow - where the wastewater flows down the inlet pipe until it reaches the bottom of tank -  in order to prevent clogs. Next, the team decided to incorporate pulse flow into the reactor to achieve the desired flow of .03 L/s. The team proposed two methods to produce pulse flow: a tipping bucket design and a siphon.\n",
        "\n",
        "UASB also worked on biogas production. The team wrote code to estimate the COD concentration of influent and the temperature of the reactor, as well as the biogas production rate based on the flow rate through the reactor. The team decided on a gas bag system to store biogas as it is flexible, easy to connect to the reactor, affordable, and easily transported. The team also wrote code to determine the required volume and dimensions for the lid of the biogas system. The team also looked into a fats, oils and greases (FOG) removal system. The conclusion was that manual skimming of FOG could always be used as a backup option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the team developed the design for the pilot UASB reactor's sludge sampling and removal system. For the sludge weir, the team chose a tube with a 6 inch diameter jutting out of the reactor at the predicted height of the sludge blanket at a downwards angle with two valves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the team wrote code to calculate the optimal size of the pilot UASB reactor's tube settler, the number of plates required, and the overall height of the settling arm.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summer 2018\n",
        "The summer team continued work on the hydraulic design of the UASB system.  The major design project was creating the tipping bucket system to deliver wastewater in pulses. The system consists of a pivoting bucket which fills with wastewater before tipping and delivering the wastewater in a large pulse at a high flow rate. After brainstorming the idea, the team designed and tested models to determine optimal design and flow rates for the system. The team also continued developing code for the entire system, and made a Computer Aided Design (CAD) [model of the UASB reactor](https://cornell47.autodesk360.com/g/shares/SH7f1edQT22b515c761e1224485004ae7e44?viewState=NoIgbgDAdAjCA0IDeAdEAXAngBwKZoC40ARXAZwEsBzAOzXjQEMyzd1C0IBOAEx4GYeAFgBsAWgBMjAGY8xQgKwTxjLl3H8A7KoBGEABwQd-IZrQBfEAF0gA) using Fusion 360.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Fall 2018\n",
        "\n",
        "  During the fall of 2018, the team tested a benchtop UASB model in the lab. Because actual sludge granules were not readily available, the team used tapioca to model the sludge blanket. Tapioca has similar material properties as sludge, inexpensive and readily available made it a suitable alternate material. Tapioca was used to identify preferential paths in the UASB reactor. Preferential pathways are the uneven distribution of wastewater flow throughout the reactor; the presence of these make the UASB reactor less efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The bench top model was a scaled down version of a real UASB reactor, made using Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). The influent was set on top perpendicular to the bottom plate and a hole was drilled at the top of the model connected with a pipe as the effluent. The team used ProCoDa software to pump the water through the influent pipe. They also added red dye to the initial pulse of water to manually to look for preferential paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The result of the testing shows that the layer of tapioca did not lift entirely off the bottom of the reactor, but instead it stretched as influent “wastewater” traveled through it. The red dye in the influent revealed the formation of preferential pathways through the tapioca layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Spring 2019\n",
        "\n",
        "  During the Spring 2019 Semester, the team focused on completing a design for the UASB reactors that will be fabricated and tested at the IAWWTP. The team decided to make reactor canisters out of 10\" diameter clear PVC pipe, so that multiple reactors could be tested at the IAWWTP to determine whether or not pulsated flow affects reactor efficiency. To design the reactors, the team made a python class to represent the hydraulics of the UASB reactors and made an onShape model of the reactors.\n"

The team must develop fabrication skills and develop best practices for the assembly of the UASB reactors. As of now, a pilot reactor barring the frame for the holding tank, has been fabricated and water tested. There was a small leak that was repaired with additional glue. Once the frame for the tipping bucket is complete, this enitre pilot reactor will be assembled and water tested. If this pilot reactor is successful, the team will build a clear reactor to install at the IAWWTP. Nearby breweries and wastewater treatment plants are still being contacted for sludge granules."

Then, attach a 1' long 1/4\" rod to the drill saw with a 2 3/8\" hole saw. Use the 1/4\" holes as a guide to drill 2 3/8\" holes at a 45° angle. The holes will need to be drilled from inside and outside of the 10\" PVC. These holes will be the sludge weir and the FOG pipe.\n",

        "4. Cut two 2.75\" length 2\" diameter PVC pipe, one for the influent and one for the effluent\n",
        "5. Use primer and PVC cement to fit the 2.75\" length pipes into the holes that are not at a 45° angle and the 4.6\" length pipes into the holes that are at a 45° angle making sure that there is enough space on the pipe sticking out of the body to fit 2\" to 1.5\" reducer. Insert the 2\" PVC pipe into the hole in the 10\" pipe and apply primer and then PVC cement liberally to ensure that all of the gaps are filled. Use a clamp or block to support the new connection. Allow to dry completely for 24 hours.\n",
        "6. Place 2\" to 1.5\" reducers on each 2\" pipe.\n",
