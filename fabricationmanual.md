# UASB Fabrication Manual

This section documents the fabrication designs for various components of the UASB reactor.

## Screening Rack
As of summer 2018, the plan is to use a series of mesh racks of decreasing pore sizes.

More research is needed to determine the exact range of mesh rack and pore sizes.

It is preferable to have the screening happen a certain distance away from the reactor although the exact details of the blueprint are yet to be determined.

## Influent System
There were initially two options for an influent system $-$ a **tipping bucket** or a **siphon**. Due to scaling issues with modeling siphons, we decided on using a tipping bucket to deliver wastewater into the reactor.
There is a detailed schematic of the tipping bucket mechanism available in the UASB Spring 2018 Manual.

### Tipping Bucket
Assuming a pulse volume input of 10-20 L, we plan to use a 5-gallon bucket that will be mounted off-centered on some sort of shaft. The bucket can rotate about the shaft, and this entire setup will be enclosed within a holding tank.

Monroe and the team came up with a couple of design choices for the tipping bucket:

1. Weld two blocks of PVC to the sides of the 5-gallon bucket. Drill a rod into each block without penetrating the bucket. These rods are used to mount the bucket at a certain height inside the holding tank.

   * **Pros**: Requires fewer materials. Is easier to fabricate.
   * **Cons**: Will need to align both rods perfectly. The welded sections will experience considerable shear. Replacing the bucket will be challenging.

2. Drill two holes in the bucket at an off-centered axis. Attach two screws to the bucket through these holes and use the screws to mount the bucket in the holding tank.

* **Pros**: Less shearing.
* **Cons**: Drilling holes makes the bucket vulnerable to leaks. Ease of replacement is still an issue.

3. Weld two brackets onto the inner wall of the holding tank. Put a hose clamp around the bucket and mount the bucket via the clamp onto two small rollers. These rollers are placed in two

### Holding Tank
The plan is to order a heavy duty pre-fabricated rectangular holding tank.
