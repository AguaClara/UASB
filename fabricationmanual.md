## Summer 2018

## Introduction

This document serves as a full guide for the fabrication of the AguaClara UASB reactor.  Each section below details the fabrication process for the individual components of the UASB reactor.  

These sections are divided into the following subsections:
* Design: Details the design decisions leading to the finalized design we are fabricating
* Fusion Model: Includes photos of our fusion model and a link to a full assembly
* Materials: Lists all the materials used to fabricate, and how they were sourced
* Fabrication steps: Detailed step by step instructions on how to fabricate the system.  Includes photos from fabrication of the first system
* Finished Product: Photos and videos of the final system after it has been fabricated.

The final section, assembly, details the process of assembling the UASB into a functional wastewater treatment reactor through step by step instructions.

The final goal is for this document is for it to serve as a full fabrication plan for the UASB reactors, so that they can be simply fabricated at low costs and installed abroad.  As such it will be a working document that will be constantly being updated with the latest changes in design and fabrication plans.  Any comments or suggestions on this document are always appreciated.

## Screening Rack
As of summer 2018, the plan is to use a series of mesh racks of decreasing pore sizes.

More research is needed to determine the exact range of mesh rack and pore sizes.

It is preferable to have the screening happen a certain distance away from the reactor although the exact details of the blueprint are yet to be determined.

## Influent System

*
There were initially two options for an influent system $-$ a **tipping bucket** or a **siphon**. Due to scaling issues with modeling siphons, we decided on using a tipping bucket to deliver wastewater into the reactor.
There is a detailed schematic of the tipping bucket mechanism available in the UASB Spring 2018 Manual.

### Tipping Bucket
Assuming a pulse volume input of 10-20 L, we plan to use a 5-gallon bucket that will be mounted off-centered on some sort of shaft. The bucket can rotate about the shaft, and this entire setup will be enclosed within a holding tank.

Monroe and the team came up with a couple of design choices for the tipping bucket:

1. Weld two blocks of PVC to the sides of the 5-gallon bucket. Drill a rod into each block without penetrating the bucket. These rods are used to mount the bucket at a certain height inside the holding tank.

   * **Pros**: Requires fewer materials. Is easier to fabricate.
   * **Cons**: Will need to align both rods perfectly. The welded sections will experience considerable shear. Replacing the bucket will be challenging.

2. Drill two holes in the bucket at an off-centered axis. Attach two screws to the bucket through these holes and use the screws to mount the bucket in the holding tank.

**(Insert design drawing here)**

* **Pros**: Less shearing.
* **Cons**: Drilling holes makes the bucket vulnerable to leaks. Ease of replacement is still an issue.

3. Weld two brackets onto the inner wall of the holding tank. Put a hose clamp around the bucket and mount the bucket via the clamp onto two small rollers. These rollers are placed in two
