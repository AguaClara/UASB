# UASB Fabrication Manual

This section documents the fabrication designs for various components of the UASB reactor.

## Screening Rack
As of now, the plan is to use a series of mesh racks of decreasing pore sizes.

More research is needed to determine the exact range of mesh rack and pore sizes.

It is preferable to have the screening happen a certain distance away from the reactor although the exact details of the blueprint are yet to be determined.

## Influent System
There were initially two options for an influent system $-$ a **tipping bucket** or a **siphon**. Due to scaling issues with modeling siphons, we decided on using a tipping bucket to deliver wastewater into the reactor.
There is a detailed schematic of the tipping bucket mechanism available in the UASB Spring 2018 Manual.
