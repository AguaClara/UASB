    "## Introduction\n",
    "Over the length of operation, anaerobes within a UASB reactor will continue to grow creating excess sludge.  In order to maintain high effluent quality and prevent unintentional discharge of biomass, it is crucial to maintain the sludge blanket height of the UASB.  In conventional UASB reactors, the height of the sludge blanket is maintained manually by discharge through multiple sampling ports on the side of the reactor.  To improve maintanence and create a operator-friendly system,  a sludge weir, based on designs of the AguaClara 1 L/s plant, will be utilized.  This document serves to calculate the size of the sludge weir required and the time required between maintenance."

    "## Critical Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In designing the biogas capture, there are many areas of uncertainty that are challenging to characterize before we can collect data from our own reactor.  In order to minimize uncertainty and provide the most accurate calculations, we used a series of assumptions for these areas.  The assumed values, and their justification and sources are detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Steady state operating conditions\n",
