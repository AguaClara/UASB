## Overview of the Training

### Overview on GitHub

- What is Git and GitHub and how are they difference?

  - **Git** is a Version Control System (VCS). Git allows you to have fine control over the changes you make to your files and revert any changes if necessary. Also, it allows you to make different "versions" of your files and edit them separately from each other.
  - **GitHub** is a cloud storage service for the files that you maintain with Git. The basic functions of Git on your computer can also be used online at github.com. Additionally, GitHub offers collaborative tools for managing tasks within a subteam, discussing issues and problems, and accepting edits to your files.

- Why do we use GitHub?

  - Git and GitHub have collaborative tools similar to those of Google Drive, but also support editing Markdown files. Markdown files are very powerful in that you can run Python code within research reports, something that Google Drive doesn't offer. Furthermore, Atom Teletype provides the same real-time editing that Google Drive offers, if you need to work on something with your teammates at the same time.
