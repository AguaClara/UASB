## Abstract
Since Spring 2017, the AguaClara Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) Team has been working on a detailed design of modified, pilot-scale UASB reactor originally developed in an EPA P3 proposal. A UASB reactor treats wastewater anaerobically and produces biogas as a by-product. Working towards that goal, the team has created Python code to record the design process and calculations for this AguaClara UASB.

For Fall 2018, the team will continue design work on the UASB with the goal of completing a full design.  Once this is done, the team will begin preparations for fabrication and implementation of the UASB at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Plant (IAWWTF).  Additionally, the team will conduct research on the flow patterns through the UASB, to ensure the reactor to will work optimally and not short-circuit.  

## Introduction

Many countries in the world lack proper access to wastewater treatment and release their wastewater directly into the environment untreated. The organic and fecal matter present in domestic water can cause harmful effects to the environment and on human health.

Organic matter in wastewater is broken down by bacteria that feed on it, consuming oxygen in the process. Depletion of dissolved oxygen levels in water can threaten and kill aquatic life.
Additionally, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus present in high concentrations in wastewater can lead to explosive algal growth in waterways, which depletes oxygen levels and can create dead zones through a process known as [eutrophication](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eutrophication.html). Fecal matter in wastewater can also cause the spread of infectious waterborne diseases like cholera, salmonella, and diarrhea, making it a huge threat to public health.

The current technology in the United States for treating municipal wastewater requires long retention times, large land areas and high monetary and energy costs. The large infrastructure and associated costs make conventional wastewater treatment unfeasible for small communities, who then resort to directly discharging their wastewater into streams. This problem can be addressed with the use of Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors.

UASB reactors are used for primary treatment and clarify wastewater by removing suspended solids organic matter ([Chong et. al, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135412002400?via%3Dihub)). Organic carbon in the wastewater flowing up through the sludge blanket is consumed by the microbes residing within the sludge.  UASB reactors also produce methane as a by-product of anaerobic digestion.  This methane can be captured and burned for energy production or heating.

UASB reactors rely on gravity to clarify wastewater and biological processes to remove organic matter and convert it to biogas. They are less energy intensive than other forms of preliminary wastewater treatment that use aerobic processes.

In January 2017, a novel pilot scale UASB reactor design was created by AguaClara for the EPA People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) [Student Design Competition proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1geug1EyFjCRLQgO79vTOXUUFia3RBw3bhaIHPUiqu44/edit?usp=sharing). This reactor was designed to improve the accessibility of wastewater treatment for small communities. The proposed UASB reactor design identified areas to improve conventional reactor design, making the system cheaper and easier to fabricate and implement globally.  The team later applied for Phase II funding from the same organization to support development and implementation of additional reactors for testing.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
***AG: ADD LINKS TO SOURCES***

UASBs are currently being used for wastewater treatment to varying degrees of success. In 2005, Sato et. al performed a case study done on 16 full-scale UASBs in the Yamuna River Basin in India (Sato, 2005)(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479705002860). The study found that the concentration of pollutants in effluent from these UASBs usually did not meet the effluent standards of most developing countries (Sato, 2005). Despite the failure of the aforementioned UASB reactors to bring wastewater to effluent standards, the study is significant in showing that UASBs are an affordable option for wastewater treatment and emphasizes the importance of designing a UASB reactor that produces effluent, which meets discharge standards.

One of the main drawbacks of UASB digesters is that there is long initial start-up period before steady-state conditions are achieved; this time is usually in the range of several months (Wang, 2018)(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11356-017-0457-5
). There are methods to decrease startup time such as increasing load, optimizing temperature for anaerobic digestion, using a sufficient amount of sludge, and adding metal or an inert carrier. A 2018 study concluded that the addition of $FeCl_3$ during the initial stage of the UASB start-up to promote granulation combined with the addition of ZVI during the middle stage of reactor start-up is highly effective in reducing the initial start-up period (Wang, 2018). Once the team fabricates the pilot UASB, studies similar to this one will be useful in strategizing how to speed up the start-up period to test UASB quicker.

In general UASB systems, removal of total suspended solids (TSS) is inversely proportional to upflow velocity within the reactor. This parameter is difficult to minimize, as decreasing upflow velocity requires decreasing flow rate, which reduces the total amount of wastewater treated. A study was done in Argentina comparing efficiency of reactors at various upflow velocities and various sludge blanket heights. At lower upflow velocities, the height of the sludge blanket didn't impact efficiency greatly provided the height was near 2/5 the height of the tank. At higher upflow velocities, it was found that a sludge blanket height of 0.92m in a 2.5m tall reactor provided optimal conditions compared to higher sludge blanket heights  [(Seghezzo, 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266880587_The_effect_of_sludge_discharges_and_upflow_velocity_on_the_removal_of_suspended_solids_in_a_UASB_reactor_treating_settled_sewage_at_moderate_temperatures).

At this height, TSS removal remains above 90% and VSS removal above 80% when the upflow velocity was between 0.30-0.7m/hr, but the best was at 0.48m/hr (TSS removal of 95%, VSS of 90%) An efficient operation could be around 0.5m/hr and height of sludge blanket= 1-2m
If you wanted to go higher, at .85m/hr -wash out wonâ€™t occur, but might not be quite as efficient
Overall low upflow velocities and taller sludge blankets tend to be the way to go. Another paper recommends an upflow velocity between 0.25m/hr and 0.8m/hr, corroborating these claims [(Ghangrekar, 2012)](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/105105048/M21L35.pdf)

Another interesting question in UASB design is removal of nitrogen from wastewater.  While UASB systems operate primarily on primary wastewater treatment, removing solids and biological oxygen demand (BOD), [Hendriksen et. al](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135496000413/1-s2.0-0043135496000413-main.pdf?_tid=6f5249d0-c415-48cb-a59f-09a1d234b245&acdnat=1538174579_6a5bf15328dfec99622739e0def12bad) offered a new approach for combined nitrogen and carbon removal from UASB systems.  In these experiments, pilot UASB systems were tested with different nutrient loading regimes in order to determine removal efficiencies of nitrogen and carbon.  Experiments began with a Hydraulic Residence Time (HRT) of 2.9 days, that was gradually lowered to 8 hours over the course of a few months.  Ultimately, the study found that given specific removal conditions the UASB could achieve a combined removal system that broke down organic nitrogen, leaving organic carbon that was then oxidized by methanogens to produce methane.  While this study may not be completely feasible for our UASB system, it offers an interesting look at further modifications of the system.

A paper published in the Netherlands ([Lattinga et. al, 1993](https://ac.els-cdn.com/096085249390038D/1-s2.0-096085249390038D-main.pdf?_tid=c83c2cd0-507e-4bba-a527-852fb5b2d0ed&acdnat=1537204715_6f79df9120ffd2cb0883ce08f1828336)) highlights how the process of granulation within the UASB is positively impacted by high upflow velocities within the UASB reactor and low hydraulic retention times. This is an important parameter to keep in mind while designing the UASB reactor.

## Timeline of UASB
#### Summer 2016
The UASB team was formed in the Summer of 2016. At that point, the objective of the team was to design and implement a functional lab-scale UASB system to treat synthetic black water. In the summer of 2016, the UASB team constructed four small-scale UASB reactors and found that those small-scale reactors could successfully treat synthetic wastewater. The team also found that increased wastewater concentration and higher residence times resulted in higher biogas removal  and increased COD removal.

#### Fall 2016
In the fall of 2016, the UASB team underwent several changes. First, the team altered the design of the small-scale UASBs by implementing shorter and narrower influent lines. The team also changed the synthetic wastewater recipe; more specifically, the team substituted glucose with insoluble carbon compounds. The team also researched retention time in the reactors with fluoride tracer tests, and found a HRT of 3.22 hours in one of the reactors,  which was not too far off from the target of 4 hours.

#### Spring 2017
During the Spring of 2017, the team worked on assessing the efficiency of two modifications to the UASB system: plate settlers and the submerged gas collection lid. After conducting granule settling tests, the team was unable to conclude whether or not plate settlers significantly improve solid retention time. The team also conducted a Submerged Gas Capture Lid Test and concluded that a check valve would be useful to allow for continuous collection into a gas tank without loss of biogas.

#### Summer 2017
In the summer of 2017, the UASB continued with similar research and testing to that of the Spring 2017 semester. This time, the team determined that plate settlers were not required for a full scale reactor; instead, a smaller settling apparatus, such as a sloped exit weir, can achieve similar sludge retention time (SRT).

#### Fall 2017
During the Fall of 2017, the UASB team made several strides. Firstly, the team made critical design assumptions for the fabrication of a a UASB treatment system at the IAWWTF . The critical design assumptions were as follows: a reactor diameter of 3 feet, a reactor height of 7 feet, a 4 hour hydraulic residence time, a flow rate of .036 L/s. The  team also designed a biogas capture lid. In this system, as biogas is produced in the reactor, it displaces water out from under the lid. Then, gas is stored there until it is manually removed. The team also wrote calculations in Jupyter to estimate biogas production based on COD input. Next, the team added an effluent tube settler to the design, which is intended to prevent dislodged granules from escaping the reactor. The Fall 2017 team also worked on designing a sludge weir for the UASB reactor.

#### Spring 2018
The UASB continued efforts to improve the design of the pilot-scale UASB during the Spring of 2018. A major area of focus was the influent flow system. After extensive research the team chose top influent flow instead of bottom influent flow to prevent clogs. Next, the team decided to incorporate pulse flow into the reactor to achieve the desired flow of .03 L/s. The team proposed two methods to produce pulse flow: a tipping bucket design and a siphon.

The next area of research during the Spring of 2018 was on biogas production. The team wrote code to estimate biogas production rate based on flow rate through the reactor, the COD concentration of influent, and the temperature of the reactor. The team decided that a gas bag would be used to store the biogas released from the reactor, since it is flexible, easy to connect to the reactor, affordable, and easily transported. The team also wrote code for the biogas capture design that returns the required volume for the temporary storage system and required dimensions for the lid. The team also looked into a fats, oils and greases (FOG) removal system and came up with the idea of an outflow pipe or siphon coming out of the removable lid with a valve to allow for the discharge of water containing fats. The team also concluded that manual skimming of FOG could always be used as a backup option.

Next, the team developed the design for the pilot UASBâ€™s sludge sampling and removal system. For the sludge weir, the team chose a tube with a 6 inch diameter jutting out of the reactor at the predicted height of the sludge blanket at a downwards angle with two valves.

Lastly, the team wrote code to calculate the optimal size of the pilot UASB tube settler, the number of plates required, and the overall height of the settling arm.

#### Summer 2018
In summer 2018, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) [model of the UASB reactor](https://cornell47.autodesk360.com/g/shares/SH7f1edQT22b515c761e1224485004ae7e44?viewState=NoIgbgDAdAjCA0IDeAdEAXAngBwKZoC40ARXAZwEsBzAOzXjQEMyzd1C0IBOAEx4GYeAFgBsAWgBMjAGY8xQgKwTxjLl3H8A7KoBGEABwQd-IZrQBfEAF0gA) was made using Fusion 360. The team decided that the best way to deliver wastewater to the UASB was to use a tipping bucket system, because it is easy to manufacture, and uses parts that are both easy to obtain and inexpensive. The summer team determined hydraulic parameters, created code for the influent system parameters, and weighed the different methods of collecting the biogas produced. A tipping bucket influent system design was finalized after testing prototypes. Preliminary bench top tests were also performed to record the flow patterns in the tank.

## Fall 2018 Goals

This semester, the team will finalize the UASB design before fabrication. First, benchtop tests will be performed to study the flow patterns through the sludge (which will be simulated using tapioca). This will allow us to test various reactor and influent conditions and check for failure. The UASB design can be modified based on the results of the tapioca tests. The plan is to consult Dr. Monroe Weber-Shirk and Dr. Todd Cowen for the details of the hydraulic design of the reactor, and also conduct literature searched for UASB designs. With this, the final dimensions of the reactor, upflow velocity, thickness of the sludge blanket and number of influent pipes can be determined.

One major part of the design process will be writing design code for the reactor.  Since the UASB system can have many design approaches, it is important to create flexible code that can test different positions and determine the required parameters.  The team will be writing this code within the design manual and testing it rigorously to get the best design solution.

The team also plans to create an updated CAD model of the UASB on OnShape (since AguaClara Cornell plans to move away from using Fusion 360 and use OnShape instead). If this cannot be accomplished the semester, it will be higher priority goal in the spring semester.

The final goal of the team this semester is to begin prepping for fabrication.  This includes locating and ordering materials, making fabrication and safety plans, and learning fabrication techniques such as plastic welding.  With this groundwork laid, the team can begin fabrication easily and have a full plan on how to proceed.

Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way. Create a schematic drawing of the apparatus (not a photo) that has clearly labeled components, flow paths, sensors, and reactor geometry.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

  <img src="https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/IMG_0009.jpg?raw=true" height=250 width=200>

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

### Figure requirements
 - Create the graph using python (not Excel)
 - If the x axis is time then make zero time reflect the beginning of the test.
 - Use a white background for all graphs.
 - Most data will have both x and y values and thus should be presented using an xy scatter plot.
 - Label all axes and include units where appropriate.
 - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph and not inside the graph border.
 - Eliminate parts of the range in both x and y axis that aren't used or that aren't meaningful.
 - Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.
 - Use data symbols to show data points unless there is so much data that the symbols overlap. If the data symbols overlap it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.
 - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.
 - If curve fitting is used explain why and include the equation (elsewhere in the report).
 - If a model or theoretical curve is presented it should be a smooth curve without data points.
 - Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.
 - Insert the graph in your report after the first reference to it in the text. Inserted the graph after the next paragraph break
 - Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images because that causes the export to Microsoft Word option to not include the image.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?
