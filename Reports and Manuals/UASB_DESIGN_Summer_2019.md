## Abstract

## Introduction

## Literature Review and Previous Work

## Methods
Since the team will be testing various lifts in the UASB reactor ranging from 1 cm to 10 cm, the team must determine the pivot positions on the sides of the tipping bucket to get the proper pulse volume. The team has begun testing for pivot positions on a 1 gallon (or 3.8 L) bucket for 5 cm of lift and on a 2 gallon bucket (or 7.6 L) bucket for 10 cm of lift. According to the python calculations, 2.5 L of water is needed to create 5 cm of lift and 5 L of water is needed to create 10 cm of lift.

[insert picture of tipping bucket diagram, include pivots]

The previous Summer 2018 team had created a frame for the tipping bucket to rest in. However, in order to decrease cost and increase convenience during testing, the team will not use a frame to hold the tipping bucket and will use a rectangular bucket with pivots screwed directly onto the sides of the bucket where there are the holes for the tested pivot positions instead.

[insert picture of previous team's tipping bucket]

Goals for tipping bucket trial:
1. Figure out pivot points for the 1 gallon bucket to pour when the water level within the bucket reaches 2.5 L.
2. Figure out pivot points for the 2 gallon bucket to pour when the water level within the bucket reaches 5 L.
3. Adjust design and materials for additional support and stability and decrease the speed in which materials wear down.

####Tools Used:
- Power drill
  - 1/4" drill bit
- Mill
  - 7/32" drill bit
- tap wrench
  - 1/4"-20 tap
- Welding Kit
- Band Saw

####Procedure:
1. Measure and mark where the middle of the bucket is on both sides of the bucket with the largest surface area.
2. Make a mark 0.75 cm horizontally from the center and 1 cm above the center on each side of the bucket. Make sure that the marks are aligned.
3. Use a power drill and 1/4" drill bit to create a hole on the off-centered marks drawn in the previous step.
4. Cut two pivots from the PVC rod with a band saw to appropriate size to fit within the LLDPE plastic tank
5. Using a mill and a 7/32" drill bit, drill a hole into the middle one of the flat sides of each pivot.
6. 


### Reactor Body
1. Attach the 1 1/2" influent pipe to the 10" PVC **add specific location for hole**. Drill a 2" hole into the 10" PVC using a drill saw. Cut a ~add length~ of 1 1/2" PVC pipe. Role the 10" PVC pipe onto its side and apply primer to the 1 3/4" hole and the 1 1/2" PVC pipe. Insert the 1 1/2" PVC pipe into the hole in the 10" pipe and apply PVC cement liberally to ensure that all of the gaps are filled. Use a clamp or block to support the pipe. Allow to dry completely for 24 hours. (Materials: 1 1/2" PVC pipe, 8' length of 10" PVC pipe, drill saw, primer, PVC cement)

2. Attach the 1 1/2" sludge weir to the 10" PVC pipe. First, drill an ellipse into the 10" PVC pipe. **add specific location for hole** Start by drilling a 1/4" hole at a 60 degree angle in the 10" canister. Then, attach a 1' long 1/4" rod to the drill saw with a 2" drill saw bit. Use the 1/4" hole as a guide to drill a 2" hole at a 60 degree angle.
(Materials: Drill saw, 1' long 1/4" rod, protractor, primer, PVC cement)

3. Drill two holes on opposite ends of the tipping bucket. Attach rods to each (Materials: 2 gallon plastic bucket, ...)
