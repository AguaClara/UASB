## Abstract

  For the past two years, the AguaClara Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Team, also known has UASB, has been in the works of designing and fabricating a pilot-scale Upflow Anaerboic Sludge Blanket reactor, a system which treats wastewater via anaerobic digestion, producing biogas in the process. UASB's design is completely gravity-powered and is a low cost solution to treating wastewater in rural communities that cannot afford typical wastewater treatment plants.

  This semester, the UASB Team divided into the two sister teams of UASB Research (UASB-R) and UASB Design (UASB-D). UASB Research is focused on benchtop testing of a model UASB, researching ways to increase the reactor's efficiency, and test out designs in lab before being implemented by UASB Design.

## Introduction

   When communities do not have access to wastewater treatment, they are forced to dump untreated wastewater directly to the environment. It eventually ends up in our rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans, and underground water sources tapped for well water [(Yahner and Taylor, 2018)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~frankenb/NU-prowd/disease.htm). Wastewater contains organic and fecal matter, which can have harmful effects on the environment. Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can invade water sources causing algae blooms, and heavy metals and other inorganic material can pollute bodies of water [(Gao, 2017)](http://isoilonline.com/2017/06/impacts-releasing-untreated-inadequately-treated-wastewater/).

  Untreated wastewater also is a significant public health risk, since wastewater can carry hundreds of different pathogens that can make a human very ill. Pathogens may be transmitted by direct contact with sewage, by eating food or drinking water contaminated with sewage, or through contact with human, animal, or insect carriers. Typhoid fever, cholera and especially diarrhea are common waterborne diseases that are often found in areas with improper wastewater treatment.

  It is difficult for many communities to find technology that can offer a reasonable, inexpensive way of treating wastewater. The United States treats its wastewater with technology that involves large retention times and take up significant amounts of land. American wastewater treatment plants also require a large energy input, because they are usually designed for densely populated urban areas, and are therefore expensive to set up and run.

  UASB’s reactor seeks to reduce the challenges of setting up wastewater treatment systems in developing countries. An UASB reactor works by pumping wastewater into the bottom of a large tank filled with colonies of methane-producing, anerobic bacteria, that form a structure called a sludge blanket. As the wastewater works its way up through the sludge blanket, the bacteria break down the organic and fecal matter and produce methane as a by-product. This has two benefits: one, this removes harmful particles in wastewater, and two, the methane automatically bubbles up to the top of the tank, where it can be collected and be burned as an energy source or heating. The water will then exit out the effluent pipe, where it can then go through a secondary treatment such as chlorination. UASB’s design, unlike other UASB reactors, is also completely gravity-powered and therefore requires zero electrical energy input. However, similar to an AguaClara plant, it requires an elevation difference to flow the wastewater through the UASB tank. This will be taken care of as long as the reactor is placed downhill from the wastewater source (e.g. a village).

## Literature Review and Previous Work

  Tamil Nadu Agricultural University did a study in 2013 on a Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor that was designed to handle 8,800 liters per day of influent wastewater where they found that the most effective volume of the reactor was 8.84 $m^3$ and that the optimum organic loading rate or the amount of water per unit of water was observed to have a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 2.67$m^-3$ per day This is the amount of oxygen needed to break down the wastewater's organic contents (so a high COD value is an indicator of a high amount of organic pollution). When the reactor operated at 3 days hydraulic retention time, or the length of time water has to sit in the reactor, the efficiency of the reactor was 70%. The reactor was also designed to collect gas that could be utilized for energy. This study done at a papaya fruit processing factory, where the reactor cost only Rs. 80,000, showed that the gas used as energy had a payback period of 3 to 4 years, which is a fast payback period compared to solar panels. It also proved that the UASB provides onsite solutions to waste management problems. [(Jeyapandiyan, 2014)](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9781848165434_0004)

  From the article “Anearobic Treatment Using UASB Reactors: Engineering and Operational Aspects” (Jules B. Van Lier et al.) shows that UASD reactor consists of 4 functional units: Primary Clarifier to remove the non biodegradable solids, Biological Reactor (secondary treatment) to remove biodegradable organic compound, Secondary Clarifier to treat effluent in the settler zone, and Sludge Digester to stabilize and improve dewatering characteristics. The article also discusses the importance of a pre-treatment and post treatment units, and gave examples of how developing countries like India do not have the support from academic institutions for researching this process when they compared it to Brazil, a country that has invested in fundamental and applied research in the subject matter. What Brazil has done, resulted in a large variety of STP (Sewage Treatment Plant)  in which the anaerobic technology is combined with adequate post treatment that offering cost-effective solution. Therefore to point out the importance of the pre-treatment process, Lier mentioned that “without an efficient pretreatment treatment, the design, operation and maintenance of UASB reactors become an impossible job”. The site visit of full-scale STP’s revealed that there are many factors that are as important as a good design: the operation and maintenance of the treatment plants.[(Lier, 2010)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308072163_Design_of_Upflow_Anaerobic_Sludge_Blanket_UASB_reactor_for_Jam_Industry_Wastes)


## Timeline of UASB
#### Summer 2016
The UASB team was formed in the Summer of 2016. At that point, the objective of the team was to design and implement a functional lab-scale UASB reactor to treat synthetic blackwater. Blackwater is wastewater from toilets. In the summer of 2016, the UASB team constructed four small-scale UASB reactors and found that those small-scale reactors could successfully treat synthetic wastewater. The team also found that increased wastewater concentration and higher residence times resulted in higher biogas removal and increased Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal.

#### Fall 2016
In the fall of 2016, the UASB team underwent several changes. First, the team altered the design of the small-scale UASB reactors by implementing shorter and narrower influent lines. The team also changed the synthetic wastewater recipe. More specifically, the team substituted glucose with insoluble carbon compounds. The team also researched retention time in the reactors with fluoride tracer tests, and found a HRT of 3.22 hours in one of the reactors (close to the target of 4 hours).

#### Spring 2017
During the spring of 2017, the team worked on assessing the efficiency of two modifications to the UASB reactor: plate settlers and the submerged gas collection lid. After conducting granule settling tests, the team was unable to conclude whether or not plate settlers significantly improve solid retention time. The team also conducted a Submerged Gas Capture Lid Test and concluded that a check valve would be useful to allow for continuous collection into a gas tank without loss of biogas.

#### Summer 2017
In the summer of 2017, the UASB team continued with similar research and testing to that of the Spring 2017 semester. This time, the team determined that plate settlers were not required for a full scale reactor. Instead, a smaller settling apparatus, such as a sloped exit weir, can achieve similar sludge retention time (SRT).

#### Fall 2017
During the fall of 2017, the UASB team made several strides. Firstly, the team settled on the critical design assumptions for the fabrication of a UASB reactor at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility (IAWWTF). The critical design assumptions were as follows: a reactor diameter of 3 feet, a reactor height of 7 feet, a 4 hour hydraulic residence time, a flow rate of .036 L/s. The  team also designed a biogas capture lid. In this system, as biogas is produced in the reactor, it displaces water out from under the lid. Gas is then stored there until it is manually removed.

The team also wrote Python calculations in Jupyter notebook (available on GitHub) to estimate biogas production based on COD input.

Next, the team decided to add plate settlers back to the effluent tube. Plate settlers are intended to prevent dislodged granules from escaping the reactor. The fall 2017 team also worked on designing a sludge weir for the UASB reactor.

#### Spring 2018
UASB continued efforts to improve the design of the pilot-scale UASB reactor in Spring 2018. A major area of focus was the influent flow system. After extensive research, the team chose top influent flow instead of bottom influent flow to prevent clogs. Next, the team decided to incorporate pulse flow into the reactor to achieve the desired flow of .03 L/s. The team proposed two methods to produce pulse flow: a tipping bucket design and a siphon.

UASB also worked on biogas production. The team wrote code to estimate biogas production rate based on the flow rate through the reactor, the COD concentration of influent, and the temperature of the reactor. The team decided on a gas bag system to store biogas as it is flexible, easy to connect to the reactor, affordable, and easily transported. The team also wrote code to determine the required volume and dimensions for the lid of the biogas system. The team also looked into a fats, oils and greases (FOG) removal system. The concluded that manual skimming of FOG could always be used as a backup option.

Next, the team developed the design for the pilot UASB reactor's sludge sampling and removal system. For the sludge weir, the team chose a tube with a 6 inch diameter jutting out of the reactor at the predicted height of the sludge blanket at a downwards angle with two valves.

Lastly, the team wrote code to calculate the optimal size of the pilot UASB reactor's tube settler, the number of plates required, and the overall height of the settling arm.

#### Summer 2018
The summer team continued work on the hydraulic design of the UASB system.  The major design project was creating the tipping bucket system to deliver wastewater in pulses.  The system consists of a pivoting bucket which fills with wastewater before tipping and delivering the wastewater in a large pulse at a high flow rate.  After brainstorming the idea, the team designed and tested models to determine optimal design and flow rates for the system.  The team also continued developing code for the entire system, and made a Computer Aided Design (CAD) [model of the UASB reactor](https://cornell47.autodesk360.com/g/shares/SH7f1edQT22b515c761e1224485004ae7e44?viewState=NoIgbgDAdAjCA0IDeAdEAXAngBwKZoC40ARXAZwEsBzAOzXjQEMyzd1C0IBOAEx4GYeAFgBsAWgBMjAGY8xQgKwTxjLl3H8A7KoBGEABwQd-IZrQBfEAF0gA) using Fusion 360.

#### Fall 2018

  During the fall of 2018, the team tested a benchtop UASB model in the lab. Because actual sludge granules for not readily available, and the team considered it to be wasteful for early testing stages, the team decided to use tapioca to model the sludge blanket. Tapioca has similar material properties as sludge, inexpensive and readily available made it a suitable alternate material. Tapioca was used to identify preferential paths in the UASB reactor. Preferential pathways cause an uneven distribution of wastewater flow throughout the reactor, making the UASB reactor less efficient.

  The benchtop model was a scaled down version of a real UASB reactor, made using pvc. The influent was set on top perpendicular to the bottom plate and a hole was drilled at the top of the model connected with a pipe as the effluent. The team used ProCoDa software to pump the water through the influent pipe. They also added red dye to the initial pulse of water to manually to look for preferential paths. It was suggested to use a second pump for inputting the dye in the future for more accurate testing.

  The result of the testing shows that the layer of tapioca did not lift entirely off the bottom of the reactor, but instead it stretched as influent “wastewater” traveled through it. The red dye in the influent revealed the formation of preferential pathways through the tapioca layer. The team then came up with the idea of spreading the inlet flow by drilling four holes near the bottom to decrease the preferential paths, but it was not completed by the end of 2018.

  So then a photometer was used to more accurately depict how the water was flowing through the sludge blanket by measuring whether or not the red dye concentration in the effluent tube was changing as expected. However, the tapioca was not a suitable material because it was too cloudy for the photometer to measure the red dye concentration.

The team then tried to used chia seeds instead of tapioca, which resulted in a worse scenario;  the chia seeds was too buoyant in water and prone to flowing out of the effluent. Ultimately the team used glass marbles  as the sludge blanket due to the time constrains. As predicted, this material was too heavy for the influent water to lift them and it was back to the drawing board.



## Spring 2019 Goals

  There are a few goals UASB Research wants to accomplish this semester. The first is the inlet system of the UASB. The UASB team was dissatisfied with the model inlet design used during the fall; the single inlet tube, whose goal was to deliver wastewater to the bottom of the reactor, was not spreading out the water evenly throughout the model sludge blanket. When the water is not evenly distributed, the reactor is less efficient; some sludge granules are not getting into contact with the wastewater, and therefore they cannot degrade the organic material in the wastewater. There was also a significant problem: the inlet tube was inserted directly above the UASB reactor, but this is where the biogas capturing system needs to be on the UASB reactor. The old design is shown below:

  <p align="center">

<p align="center">Fig. 2: Old lab scale model of UASB reactor<p>

  Between these two problems, and the fact UASB's old inlet system vanished in early February, a new model-scale inlet system desperately needs to be created. The team has sketched out a few designs - all with four openings in the inlet, in order to better distribute flow. An idea to put in a manifold was shut down over concerns of clogging. UASB-R has already got the parts in order to create one of the designs, and the contruction of that design has started. This is Design #1, without the attachment with the four openings.

<p align="center">Fig. 3: Beginnings of the first inlet design of 2019

 As one can see, the inlet tube enters on the right side of the tank with a horizontal component. UASB is also interested what would happen if the inlet tube was inserted lower down. Would the water velocity be the same? Does one design have more head loss than the other? The two competing designs, as shown below, will be what UASB will be testing out.

<p align="center">Fig. 4: Two competing designs; sketch does not include effluent design or biogas capture system.

After UASB-R settles on one design, the rest of the semester will be devoted to:

- Constructing and testing the four-opening attachment for the lab bench model

- Run tests to determine pulse flow vs continuous flow. Orginally, UASB was under the impression pulse flow would increase efficiency in the UASB reactor by increasing upflow velocity, but new research has been pointing toward continuous flow.

Both these tests will be run using actual sludge granules from the Aanheuser-Busch Plant in Syracuse, NY. One of our members will be going there to pick up the sludge on March 9th.

- Lastly, keep in close contact with UASB Design and see if there are any features they would like UASB Research to test in the lab.

## Lab Experiments

### Current Testing: Results and Analysis

In order to test for where the inlet tube should be inserted into the UASB reactor, we created an experiment to test the exit velocity of the water as it is taken out through the effluent tube. We designed two different inlet systems that come in at two different heights of the benchtop model, as shown in Figure 4. The system was fabricated, the team tested it with only water (no sludge) to check for reactor performance. However, realizing there were leaks between the drilled hole and the 0.5 inches inlet pipe, the team made fixed it by drilling a larger hole and attaching a threaded fitting with seal tape to prevent leaks.

<p align="center">Fig. 6: the fixed connection

The team was now able to perform a test experiment with old sludge. While sludge can stay alive in a suspended state in a fridge for up to year, UASB-R only has a small amount at the moment. The plan was to get more sludge in early March, but AguaClara's contact for sludge granules  has retired from his job and is unable to obtain them anymore. Prof. Ruth Richardson of the CEE department is working to find a new person to get sludge granules from. The small amount will be enough to finish the testing and experiments described below.

It should also be stated that the team is working off the same [UASB model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9ad827a5eca9b7988dc2f6a0/w/b0be5680611b0cca297e07f2/e/01184b12f18fae4acc6559c3) as UASB-Design.

### Future Testing:
Now that fabrication is complete, the team's next step is to gather volume data with and without sludge to check whether a higher versus a lower inlet allows for a greater output of water thus lower headloss. The team will monitor differing input water velocity, time, and output volume of water and analyze their relationships to justify which inlet height has the least headloss. Once a proper height is fixed, the team will move onto testing the inlet, with the sludge blanket, to check for preferential paths.

The inlet consists of four different openings. The idea behind this is that it will allow for more wastewater to come into contact with the sludge, thus making the UASB reactor more efficient by taking a greater proportion of pollutants out of the wastewater. The inlet is still currently being worked on; a few parts need to be ordered and shipped, and an onshape model of the design is in the process of being created.

 This test will be more research-based, with focus on gathering data on preferential paths to inform UASB-Design team how the water will flow and interact with the sludge in the real reactor. Further specifications of this test will be defined and noted.
