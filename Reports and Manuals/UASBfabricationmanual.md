# UASB Fabrication Manual

## Summer 2018

### Ian Cullings, Ananya Gangadhar, Isa Kaminsky

## Introduction

This document serves as a full guide for the fabrication of the AguaClara UASB reactor.  Each section below details the fabrication process for the individual components of the UASB reactor.  

These sections are divided into the following subsections:
* Fusion Model: Includes photos of our fusion model and a link to a full assembly
* Materials: Lists all the materials used to fabricate, and how they were sourced
* Fabrication steps: Detailed step by step instructions on how to fabricate the system.  Includes photos from fabrication of the first system
* Finished Product: Photos and videos of the final system after it has been fabricated.

The final section, assembly, details the process of assembling the UASB into a functional wastewater treatment reactor through step by step instructions.

The final goal is for this document is for it to serve as a full fabrication plan for the UASB reactors, so that they can be simply fabricated at low costs and installed abroad.  As such it will be a working document that will be constantly being updated with the latest changes in design and fabrication plans.  Any comments or suggestions on this document are always appreciated.

For more information on the AguaClara UASB project, visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB).  There you can find our research reports, design code, and research presentations.  The compliment to this manual is the [UASB Design Manual](https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB/blob/master/UASBdesignmanual.md), which details the entire design process.

## Screening Rack
As of summer 2018, the plan is to use a series of mesh racks of decreasing pore sizes.

More research is needed to determine the exact range of mesh rack and pore sizes.

It is preferable to have the screening happen a certain distance away from the reactor although the exact details of the blueprint are yet to be determined.

## Influent System

### Tipping Bucket
As detailed in our [Design Manual](https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB/blob/master/UASBdesignmanual.md), we settled on a single tipping bucket system built within a plastic entrance tank.

#### Materials

For initial fabrication of this system, we purchased the following materials:

**Materials Notes:**  According to welding experts on the web, you can weld LDPE to LLDPE, but not HDPE to LLDPE.

####Experimental steps
#####Tipping Bucket
The team had to find the optimal positions for the pivots and the brackets supporting the bottom of the bucket so that the bucket would fill up with enough water and tip enough to dump all the water out. If the pivots were too far from the center, the bucket would tip before filling with enough water. If the pivots were too close, the bucket wouldn't tip enough to empty out all of the water. The team decided that a good range for the ideal amount of water to fill the bucket is 15L-25L.

The team marked the center of each bar that the pivots are on and tested the tipping bucket with the pivots at certain distances from that center. The height of the brackets were adjusted as needed.

To find the amount of water that was in the bucket just before tipping, the team marked on the bucket vertical heights every 1 cm and recorded the height of the water level just before tipping. The volume was found by using the water level height and bucket diameter.

| Pivot distance from center | Bracket Height | Volume filled | Completely Emptied? |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
|                            |                |               |                     |
|                            |                |               |                     |
|                            |                |               |                     |

## UASB Reactor Tank
Initial plans for the UASB modeled the 1 L/s plant, which used a 3 ft diameter PVC pipe as the outer base of the reactor.  However, with further exploration it was determined that a prefabricated tank could be used for the same system, offering a much cheaper alternative that could be more structurally stable and easier to build from.
