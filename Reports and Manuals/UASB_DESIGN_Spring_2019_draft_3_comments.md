## Abstract
Since Spring 2017, the AguaClara Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) Team has been working on a detailed design for a pilot-scale, gravity-powered UASB reactor. A UASB reactor treats wastewater anaerobically and produces biogas as a by-product.

During Spring 2019, the UASB-Design team's main goal was to finalize the design for the UASB and support the design with substantial Python code and CAD designs. So far, the team has completed a general CAD design on Onshape for the entire UASB reactor and used python coding to predict how the geometry of the UASB design will influence the up flow velocity of wastewater through the reactor.

##Introduction
In the past, AguaClara has focused on creating sustainable and inexpensive drinking water treatment, and has recently expanded to wastewater treatment. Previously, AguaClara has struggled to find demand for wastewater treatment plants in Nicaragua or Honduras because people were reluctant to invest ~~a~~ in **[a]** system that would not directly affect the health of community members. Fortunately, a growth in awareness in regards to the importance of wastewater treatment as well as funding from EPA for the development of wastewater treatment technologies allowed AguaClara to move forward with its venture into sustainable wastewater treatment. One project AguaClara established for its undertaking in wastewater treatment that of designing and fabricating pilot scale UASB reactor. Upon completion, the pilot UASB reactor will be tested with wastewater at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility (IAWWTF).


 In a UASB reactor, wastewater flows through a sludge blanket. The sludge blanket contains millions of methane-producing bacteria which consume many of the organic pollutants in the wastewater. As a result, effluent from the UASB can be returned to the environment safely. There is still much that needs to be further discovered and refined, such as whether or not the tipping bucket system will be useful in eliminating preferential pathways, the effluent system design, and the methane gas capture system.

## Literature Review and Previous Work

According to [US Geological Survey](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wuww.html) (USGS), ~~Wastewater~~ **[wastewater]** is any kind of water used by humans. This used water may include dissolved fecal and urine matter, harmful chemicals, pathogens, and many more pollutants. Because it is full of contaminants **[,]** it's not longer safe for use. Because water is a universal solvent, it becomes difficult to separate the water from these harmful compounds. These compounds come from a variety of sources such as household wastes from toilets, sinks, baths, and drains or from factories, farming, schools, and urban runoff. As a result, billions of gallons of wastewater ~~is~~ [are] produced and yet many areas in the world still lack access to wastewater treatment plants, thus making wastewater a global issue. Leaving wastewater untreated and releasing it directly back into the environment can produce devastating effects on both the environment and human health.

Wastewater can also contain decaying organic matter and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which can cause eutrophication, a term for excess nutrients. Eutrophication then causes algae blooms, leading to oxygen-deprived conditions once the large amount of algae dies off and begins to decompose. This negatively impacts the ecosystem because the lack of oxygen makes it harder for aquatic life to survive. At high concentrations, these water pollutants and organic matter are killing marine birds, crustaceans, sea weeds, and many other organisms. Having too much nitrogen in water can also be dangerous for humans because it can cause methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome) by preventing normal uptake of oxygen in the blood.

Human health is also directly affected by a lack of wastewater treatment. Much of untreated wastewater eventually ends up in our rivers, streams, and sometimes ground water. It is often assumed that groundwater is pure and clean; however, it is possible for groundwater to be contaminated by wastewater seeping into the ground. ([Catherine Taylor & Joseph Yahner, 1996](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~frankenb/NU-prowd/disease.htm)). When wastewater reaches drinking water sources, it can pose significant health risks for the community. Pathogens in wastewater destroy crop production, infecting the food supply, and cause water-borne diseases. Some of the many bacteria, viruses, and parasites present in wastewater include: cholera, typhoid, giardiasis and  cryptosporidiosis. ([Catherine Taylor & Joseph Yahner, 1996](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~frankenb/NU-prowd/disease.htm)). Health risks associated with wastewater includes respiratory disease, cancer, diarrheal disease, a neurological disorder, and cardiovascular disease ([Mehtab Haseena, 2017](http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/water-pollution-and-human-health-7925.html)).

Some of the biggest issues that wastewater treatment plants face today are energy consumption and environmental footprints. Wastewater facilities typically have treatment processes that include preliminary treatment, sedimentation, chlorination, and processing sludge which are all electrically and fuel powered ([AOS, 2018](https://aosts.com/how-much-energy-does-wastewater-treatment-plant-use/)). In 2018, there were about 14,748 wastewater treatment plants in the US and electricity accounts for 90-95% of the total energy consumed at these facilities while the rest is accounted by fuels such as oil or natural gas. ([University of Michigan, 2019](http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-wastewater-treatment-factsheet)). Wastewater Treatment plants end up using up about 3% of the nation’s total energy consumption ([MGOe, 2019](https://www.mge.com/saving-energy/business/bea/article_detail.htm?nid=%202431)). However, not all countries have access or can afford the same resources such as money, infrastructure, materials, and technology, which makes having universal wastewater treatment plants not feasible in many parts of the world, especially more rural and less developed areas.

Traditional UASB reactors are used as a preliminary wastewater treatment process to remove suspended solids organic matter in wastewater (Chong et. al, 2012). UASB reactors, instead of using fuel or electricity, rely mainly on gravity and biological processes to remove organic matter and convert it to biogas. UASB stands for Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket and a UASB reactor is a single tank process where wastewater enters the reactor and flows upward through a suspended sludge blanket. This suspended sludge blanket is made up of cultures of anaerobic microorganisms that filters and cleans wastewater by removing organic contaminants and pathogens. UASB reactors are highly efficient in treating high COD loads, biogas formation, and provide good stabilization of solids ([M.K. Daud, 2018](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2018/1596319/)).They are less energy intensive than other forms of preliminary wastewater treatment that use aerobic processes. UASB reactors also produce methane as a byproduct of anaerobic digestion which can be captured and used for energy production or heating. However, these UASB reactors still rely on electricity.

AguaClara, on the other hand, has designed a UASB reactor that solely relies on gravity. It’s main function is to improve the accessibility and affordability of wastewater treatment for smaller communities that don’t have access to electricity. In January 2017, this gravity-powered UASB reactor was designed for the EPA People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) Student Design Competition proposal. The proposed UASB reactor design focused on improving reactor design, making the system cheaper and easier to fabricate so that it could be created globally. The team later applied for Phase II funding from the same organization to support the development and implementation of additional reactors for testing and received a grant of $75,000.

**Summer 2018**
In Summer 2018 the team worked on the hydraulic design of the UASB system and created a tipping bucket system which delivered wastewater in large pulses at a high flow rate. The team had two possible designs for the influent system--one option was for influent tubes to enter either at the top of the UASB reactor, and the alternative was for influent tubes to enter the UASB reactor at the bottom. The team also focused on biogas storage and decided that a gas bag system was the best option. In a gas bag system, gas will flow out of a pipe in the lid of the UASB into a gas bag. Pros of the gas bag system are that it is inexpensive and allows for the easy transport of biogas to communities for use.

**Fall 2018**
Preferential pathways in wastewater treatment occur when incoming wastewater forms a tunnel through the sludge blanket instead of flowing evenly through the blanket; consequently, not all of the wastewater gets in contact with sludge granules, and thus not effectively treated. In Fall 2018, the UASB team researched preferential pathways in UASB by doing bench tests. The team fabricated a small scale UASB reactor used chia seeds, marbles, and tapioca to simulate sludge. The Fall 2018 UASB team found that preferential flow patterns were likely to occur. The team concluded that it will likely be necessary to have several influential pipes to promote the even distribution of wastewater flow and decrease preferential pathways. The figure below shows a tapioca test from the Fall 2018 semester. The uneven distribution of red dye through the tapioca layer indicates that preferential pathways are forming.

**Fig. 1: Preliminary dye tests with tapioca showing preferential pathways<p>**

**Spring 2019**
In the Spring 2019 semester, the team focused on finalizing the UASB pilot-scale reactor design which would be fabricated and tested in Ithaca’s Wastewater Treatment Plant in the Summer of 2020.

## Methods

### Design for Influent System

This section explains how the Spring 2019 team made decisions regarding the design for the influent system.

For the influent system, the team decided to move forward with the Summer 2018 team's design in which a tipping bucket empties wastewater into a holding tank, which will then empty into a flow dividing bucket connected to influent pipes that lead into the side of the reactor. The Summer 2018 team's tipping bucket design is included below in Figure 2.

A design for the tipping bucket was completed by the summer 2018 team.

![Summer 2018 tipping bucket design](https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB/blob/master/Images/Influent_Tank_Tipping_Bucket.png?raw=true)
**Figure 2. Summer 2018 Final Tipping Bucket design**

The team also chose move forward with the Summer 2018 team’s plan to use a [300 gallon reactor tank](https://www.plastic-mart.com/product/17049/300-gallon-plastic-tank-rotoplas-590314-590315) that has a 36” diameter and 72” height.

The team decided to use high density polyethylene (HDPE) for the majority of the plastic parts of the UASB, such as the influent pipes and the 300 gallon reactor tank, would need to be welded together. HDPE was chosen because it is durable and corrosion resistant, and large tanks made of HDPE, unlike PVC, are available. HDPE can be welded together with other HDPE materials whereas welding it with PVC or LDPE is not be feasible.

This semester, the team realized an issue with the previous team's tipping bucket design: the frame for the tipping bucket is metal. This would cause issues as the metal frame would get wet from splashing water and hence rust. To combat this issue, the team altered the design of the tipping bucket to exclude metal parts.

Certain elements from the previous team's tipping bucket design, including the volume of the tipping bucket and the locations of the pivots with respect to the bucket's center will remain the same. The previous team determined the optimal location of pivots by performing tests with pivots in various positions and selecting the locations in which the tipping bucket filled the most while still emptying completely.

**Table 1. Summer 2018 Tipping Bucket Trial Results**
| Trial | Horizontal Pivot Position (from center) (cm) | Vertical Position (center of pivot to base of bucket) (cm)  | Height Filled (cm)| Volume Filled (L)| Emptied Completely|
| -------- | ----------------|--------------- | --------- | ---------| -------|
| 1    | 0.25  | 16.5 | 21 | 14.8 | yes |
| 2 | 0.5 | 16.5| 22 | 15.56 | yes|
|3   | 0.5  | 19.3  |  x | x | no|
|4   | 0.5  | 18.5  |  x |  x | no |
|5   | 0.75  |  18.5 |  22 | 15.56  | yes |
| 6  |   0.75|   15.5|  22 | 15.56  | yes  |
|7   |  0.5 |  15.5 | 23  | 16.26  | yes |

The calculation for the volume in Liters filled of the bucket is shown below.

```python
from aide_design.play import*
bucket_height = 23 * u.cm
bucket_diam = 30* u.cm
area = pc.area_circle(bucket_diam)
vol = area * bucket_height
print(vol.to(u.L))
 ```

Based on the Summer 2018 team's results, the pivots will be positioned 5 cm horizontal from the center of the tipping bucket and 15.5 cm above the base of the bucket (both measurements are made from the center of the pivot). The volume of one tip from the tipping bucket is expected to be 16.26 liters.

**[Wondering why these constraints were used Summer 2018's results. As in why not go to 1 cm in the Horizontal Pivot Position or lower than 15.5 for Vertical Position? If there is a clear explanation as to the limits I would include that here.]**

## Redesigning the Tipping Bucket
The 2019 spring team decided to remake the original metal frame from an HDPE sheet. The team ordered HDPE sheet and cut it into rods to replicate the geometry of the original frame that was constructed from 80/20 extrusions. The team determined that a 1 inch thick 48" by 24" sheet would be sufficient material and strenght of 1 inch would be sufficient to hold up the bucket.

## Flow Dividing Tank
Wastewater from the tipping bucket is dumped into a flow dividing tank. The purpose of the flow dividing tank is to ensure that the four influent pipes receive an equal inflow of wastewater.  The flow dividing tank is partitioned into four equal sections. Figure 3 shows a top view of these sections. Each of the four sections drains into a separate inlet pipe. The figures below illustrate the flow dividing tank.

**Figure 5. The dimensions for bottom of the flow dividing tank. (In inches)**

It would be imperative that each section in the flow dividing tank fills with wastewater before the wastewater starts flowing into the influent pipes so that each pipe will distribute the same amount of water inside the reactor. It is also desirable for the flow dividing tank to empty out completely between each dump of the tipping bucket as a de-clogging mechanism. These constraints mean that the flow dividing tank should be similar in volume to the tipping bucket, the bottom of the flow dividing tank should be in line **[in line like at same elevation?]** with the water line in the reactor, and the diameter of influent pipes should be small enough so that the pipes drain slowly enough to allow for wastewater to overflow into all sections of the flow dividing case, in case the wastewater from the tipping bucket fills up only one section first. All of these constraints  are further described and investigated in the Python Documentation section.

In order for the de-clogging mechanism to occur, the water level inside the reactor's canister must be in line with the bottom of the flow dividing tank. Assuming that the reactor is about 80% full of liquid, the height of the water in the reactor would be roughly 5 ft. The team can set this level during the startup phase by adding water/sludge to the reactor until the desired height is reached. With that in mind, the bottom of the flow dividing tank should also be located at a height of roughly 5 ft.

##Influent Pipes
The Summer 2018 UASB team suggested 2 influent pipes, but after considering the results of the tapioca tests performed by the Fall 2018 team, the Spring 2019 UASB team decided to use four influent pipes to promote ~~more even~~ distribution of flow **[more evenly]** through the sludge blanket. The Summer 2018 UASB team also suggested that the influent pipe diameter range from 75-100mm to reduce clogging. However, the current team decided to decrease the diameter of the influent pipe to range from 1-2 inches **[Is there a reason you guys didn't consistently use imperial vs metric pipe diameters? Would keep it consistent unless it's unavoidable]**. The team made that decision based on two constraints: a diameter much smaller than one inch would be more likely to cause clogging and result in ~~a too-slow~~ **[too slow of an]** upflow velocity of wastewater through the reactor, and a diameter much larger than one inch would be less effective in promoting even flow through influent tubes.


Each inlet pipe will then carry wastewater to a point on the bottom of the reactor. The team has positioned the four points of influence are as far away from each other as possible on the bottom of the reactor. The bottom of the UASB reactor has a diameter of 3 ft. So, if the center of the reactor is considered to be the origin, then the four points of influence on the bottom of the reactor in polar coordinates will be: (9”, $pi$/4 rad), (.9”, 3$pi$/4 rad), (9”, -$pi$/4 rad), (9”, -3$pi$/4 rad). Figure four illustrates the locations of the points of influence to the bottom of the reactor.


<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB/blob/master/Images/Points%20of%20Influence.png?raw=true">

**Figure 6. The points of influence on the bottom of the reactor.**

After deciding on the locations for the points of influence on the bottom of the reactor, the team discussed ways to the amount of horizontal piping because settling of wastewater is more likely to occur in horizontal pipe **[part after "ways to" sounds off. If this is misworded please address]**. The team decided to attach ~~attached~~ the holding tank to the side of the reactor to ~~to~~ reduce settling and to ensure the reactor is compact.

Wastewater flow from the flow dividing bucket drains into vertical pipes. The wastewater needs to be directed to enter the side of the reactor through horizontal pipes. Horizontal entry was decided for ease of fabrication, since it would be difficult to drill ellipses into the UASB reactor to allow for diagonal entry. The team considered using 135 degree elbows instead of 90 degree elbows to minimize horizontal flow, as settling is more likely to occur in horizontal pipes. However, after floating the idea at a technical feedback session, the team realized that such pipes may not be readily available in Honduras, and decided to use [90 degree](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3-in-PVC-DWV-90-Degree-H-x-H-Vent-Elbow-C4807VHD3/205799553) elbows in the design.

Next, the team decided where the influent pipes enter the reactor. During tapioca tests in fall 2018 semester, the team noticed that preferential pathways tended to form around vertical sections of pipe in the sludge blanket. With that in mind, the team decided to have pipes enter the reactor near the ground to reduce the amount of vertical pipe running through the sludge blanket. The team decided to have pipes enter the reactor at heights of 10 inches and 20 inches above the ground (where the distance is measured from the bottom of the pipe). Then, each pipe extends horizontally until it is above its respective point of influence, at which point the pipe is directed down to the bottom of the reactor with a 90 degree elbow. Finally, each pipe will travel vertically until it is 1 inch above the bottom of the reactor. At this point, wastewater will exit into the reactor, hit the bottom, and then begin flowing upwards through the sludge blanket.

## Future Work
In order to reach the goal of fabrication, UASB Design must also complete the design for the effluent system, gas collection, and support system while considering materials for the entire reactor.

After deciding that the majority of the UASB reactor will be made up of HDPE, research has to be done in finding pipes and reactor tank made up of this material. For the biogas, instead of using a ballo[o]n contraption to collect methane gas, a bubble counter meter will be used to see how much biogas is being created. Once the design is finished, the methane gas will be burned off by a mechanism in the Ithaca's Waste Water Treatment Facility.

For the effluent system a valve needs to be added at the end to ensure there will be consistent effluent flow and make maintenance accessibility easier. Since the effluent pipe will begin extruding out from the UASB reactor upwards at 60 degrees to make sure the sludge granules settle back into the reactor, the team also has to figure out a way to add a pipe going vertically upwards through the effluent pipe to make sure atmospheric pressure is the same throughout. If atmospheric pressure can be maintained through the fabrication of the vertical pipe, the effluent pipe will ideally bend at the middle from upwards 60 degrees to a downwards vertical pipe that empties the effluent. Unfortunately, finding 30 degree connections are rather difficult to find in Honduras, so the team has yet to settle on a design of the effluent pipe.

Initially to support the influent system and pipes, the team had decided to use 80/20 extrusions; however, upon further consideration of the environment in which the reactor will be tested, the team will prioritize materials [that can support heavy objects while being] ~~that are~~ [both] resistant to rusting and **[maintained easily]** ~~easily maintained but also able to support heavy objects~~.

Upon completing the design for the frame, the team will fabricate the influent system based on its design and begin testing it with water.

The optimal height and cross-sectional area for the influent pipes to be entering the tank still needs to be determined so that the flow of wastewater passing through the sludge will be between .0069 m/s - .02778 m/s . It is desirable for the upflow velocity to be faster than the velocity of the sludge granules settling to keep the bed fluidized but not so fast that the granules washout because of inadequate residence time. The research team is currently testing whether the entry of influent pipes above the sludge or the entry of influent pipes close to the bottom will result in less preferential pathways. Once UASB design receive this information, the team can finalize on the sections of the length of the pipes that will be vertical and horizontal.

## Python Documentation
This python documentation is used to determine the relationship between drain time from the flow tank, diameter of the influent pipes, geometry of the flow dividing tank, and resulting up flow velocity, so that the team can make better informed design decisions. The code is below, and comments have been added for clarity.

The time it takes for the flow dividing tank to drain should be slow enough so that in case the bucket initially fills up just one division of flow dividing tank, it will not begin emptying out until overflow reaches other sections, but fast enough so that the tank completely drains out between successive dumps of the tipping bucket for self cleaning purposes and so that up flow velocity of influent water is fast enough to lift settling sludge particles. This drain time is determined by the diameter of the influent pipes and the head gain per dump of the tipping bucket, and the ensuing code will be used to determine the optimal combination of influent pipe diameter and flow dividing tank geometry to achieve said drain time.

##Analysis of Python Documentation
A major restriction on the influent system for the UASB was ensuring the ability to suspend the sludge particles in the reactor. This was dictated by the settling velocity for sludge particles. After conducting research into finding the settling velocity, the UASB team found that the velocity varies with density of sludge particles, ranging from 0.0009 m/s to 0.0167 m/s ((Miranda, Borges, & Monteggia 2017). As the 0.0167 cm/s up-flow occurs are exceptionally high densities of sludge, ~~we~~ **[UASB-D]** would be requiring up-flow velocities closer the mean settling velocity of 0.0004m/s. Below are figures showing the calculated correlation between the pipe diameter and the drain time of the flow dividing tank, from which the up-flow velocity in the reactor was deduced.


![Pipe Diameter vs Drain Time](https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB/blob/master/Images/Pipe%20Diamter%20vs%20Drain%20Time.png?raw=true)

**Fig. 11: Pipe Diameter vs Drain Time**

![Pipe Diameter vs Upflow Velocity](https://github.com/AguaClara/UASB/blob/master/Images/Pipe%20Diameter%20vs%20Upflow%20Velocity.png?raw=true)

**Fig. 12: Pipe Diameter vs Upflow Velocity**


From the restriction from the settling velocity and the corresponding up-flow velocities from pipe diameters, the UASB design team decided to utilize an influent pipe with 1.5 inch diameter.

**[Why exactly did you choose 1.5 inches? I am quite lost as to the relationship between drain time, settling velocity, and upflow velocity. I read the excerpt above python documentation as well but that did not clarify things for me. Granted, I did not dig through your code, but if it's possible state the constraints that you are using for each parameter]**

Other takeaways from the python are that the height of walls in the flow dividing tank should be 9.522 inch and the maximum flow of wastewater this UASB can handle is 0.0695 liter / second.

All of these calculations were based on the parameters that were initialized in the UASB object. Temperature is 25 degree celcius, the cannister diameter is 3 ft. The height of the effluent pipe is 5 feet. The volume of one dump from the tipping bucket is 16.26 L. The width of the flow dividing tank is 9.937 inches, the height of the flow dividing tank is 16.8125 inches, the thick~~e~~ness of the flow dividing walls are 1/4 inch, there are 3 elbows per influent pipe, and HRT is 4 hours. **[Would recommend a table here with all the parameters rather than describing in words]**
