        "The Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) team has been furthering the design and testing of a gravity-powered wastewater treatment system that can transform waste into energy. This semester, the team is continuing testing of the gas collection system of the UASB. The membrane reactor, which acts as a polishing step for the system, has been running in the lab and the team has been testing the reactor’s gas content and effluent, as well as the influent and effluent of the UASB. The team has expanded upon the data for several lab tests which will guide future improvements to the UASB."

        "## Introduction\n",
        "### Research Overview and Goals\n",
        "The fight for safe access to clean drinking water is continuous and requires critical thinking from a variety of perspectives. Untreated wastewater is a human health risk that contributes to water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. The United Nations World Water Assessment Programme (2017) estimates that over 80% of the world’s wastewater is released into the environment without treatment, putting both ecosystems and human health at risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a need for new, simple treatment systems that can be implemented in areas where wastewater currently goes untreated. Not all treatment systems are created equally, so designing a variety of adaptable systems is crucial to best meet the needs of specific communities. Conventional wastewater treatment methods used in the United States are not suitable for many small rural communities as they are expensive, energy intensive, and use mechanical parts that require a reliable source of electricity. The objective of the UASB team’s research is to develop a small-scale, decentralized wastewater treatment system that will be affordable and accessible to rural communities. Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) technology can remove organic matter from wastewater and be designed to operate without electricity. The unique benefit of UASB technology is that methane gas is a product of treatment. This can be collected (most simply in old car tires) and used as an energy source. After wastewater is treated with a UASB, it goes through a membrane reactor as a finishing step. The effluent from this reactor then needs further treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The UASB subteam received two grants (Phase I and Phase II) as part of the EPA People, Prosperity, and the Planet (P3) program to support small-scale testing of a prototype UASB reactor at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility (IAWWTF). Phase I of research focused on developing a complete design for a gravity-powered UASB reactor, including a gas capture system and influent dosing system. Phase II research (the current phase) focuses on four main goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improving the influent dosing system and floatables removal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Characterizing startup and performance of gravity-powered UASB reactors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Determining appropriate options for effluent post treatment and biogas utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Iterating designs and installing and testing a distributed UASB reactor in Honduras.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Spring 2022 semester, the main goal for the team was to refine the gas collection system of the UASB at IAWWTF and upgrade the size of the Membrane Reactor. There is still no gas being collected when wastewater is being treated with the UASB. The gas system has not been fully refined and the team will continue investigating the issue next semester. This needs to be further addressed before more research is conducted regarding the gas composition. This is an important issue to address because it halts further energy research. The team focused on transferring the membrane reactor to a larger vessel and replacing the tubes with a new system that is more suitable for the wastewater. Research was done to make sure the upscale Carboy can hold gas without leaks. Further general wastewater testing was done including COD, ammonium assay, and turbidity tests during the semester. This will be used to guide fabrication of the UASB system in the future.\n",

        "The influent wastewater comes from the IAWWTF’s primary influent (after it has been filtered for large, suspended solids). The connection to the facility’s influent wastewater contains a tee (Figure 1a), splitting the pipe into two directions. Wastewater is pulled through the vertical branch of the pipe (Figure 1b) by a peristaltic pump (Figure 1c), and travels to the UASB reactor through clear, flexible tubing (Figure 1d). The horizontal branch (Figure 1e) of the pipe serves two purposes: first, it provides an access point to push water through the system in the case of clogging. Second, it provides an easy way to divide the flow of wastewater into different directions, allowing multiple UASB reactors to be installed in parallel. To add another UASB reactor to the system, the fernco (Figure 1e, boxed) can be loosened to split the horizontal branch of pipe into two pieces, and an additional tee can be installed in between the fixed end and the capped end (Figure 1f) of the pipe. An additional pumping system for the new UASB reactor can be added by either stacking another pump-head onto the peristaltic pump already present, or adding a new peristaltic pump entirely. \n",

        "\n",
        "Conventional wastewater treatment in the United States is a multistep process that is energy-consuming, lengthy and costly (Kassab et al., 2010). In the US, wastewater treatment includes preliminary, primary, secondary and tertiary treatment, and disinfection. Preliminary treatment removes garbage and other large solids, typically through coarse screening. Primary treatment is a physical step of the treatment that removes settleable organic and inorganic solids by sedimentation. Secondary treatment removes residual organics and suspended solids (Ma et al., 2015). Tertiary treatment removes nitrogen and phosphorus, heavy metals, dissolved solids, and suspended solids. Disinfection by chlorine is the last step of the process. Overall, conventional wastewater treatment systems have long retention times, require large land areas, and have a high fixed cost per capita (Chong et al,. 2012). These high fixed costs make conventional wastewater treatment systems inaccessible for small communities. \n",
        "\n",
        "For developing countries, biological treatment processes are more common, since they require lower capital investments and operational costs without chemical or energy input (Mittal, 2011).  Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors are a well established technology for wastewater use in the global south. Traditional UASB  reactors are used as a preliminary wastewater treatment process to remove suspended solid organic matter in wastewater (Chong et. al, 2012). UASB reactors rely mainly on gravity and biological processes to remove organic matter and convert it to biogas, instead of using fuel or electricity. They are anaerobic reactors which do not require energy-intensive or expensive aeration. Organic pollutants are converted into biogas, primarily composed of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and may also contain hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (Abbasi & Abbasi, 2012). Biogas can be collected and used for fuel, or burned to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Biogas as fuel is promising in areas that do not have access to electricity (Chong et al., 2012).\n",
        "\n",
        "A UASB reactor is a single tank in which wastewater enters and flows upwards through a sludge blanket made up of anaerobic microorganisms, as shown in Figure 18. This blanket filters and cleans wastewater by removing organic contaminants and pathogens. UASB reactors are more feasible for small communities since they are less energy intensive, highly efficient in treating high COD loads, and form biogas. This biogas includes methane as a byproduct which can be captured and used for heating or energy production if electricity is unavailable. \n",

        "UASBs utilize mixed cultures of anaerobic microorganisms to biologically process and remove organic matter (OM), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and suspended solids (SS). They are designed to operate at short hydraulic retention times (HRT) and long solids retention time (SRT) to increase loading capacity and improve sludge stabilization. Due to the dispersion of influent to maximize sludge contact, UASBs can achieve optimal levels of primary treatment quite quickly compared to other anaerobic treatment processes. In alternative processes such as anaerobic filters, anaerobic baffled reactors, and septic tanks, water passes over an exposed surface of sludge and organic matter is treated as it diffuses through (Chong et. al, 2012).\n",
        "\n",
        "While UASBs are able to provide treatment quickly, like other anaerobic treatment methods, post-treatment is often required through trickling filters or secondary clarifiers to achieve ideal reduction in BOD, COD, and nutrients (Abbasi & Abbasi, 2012)."

BOD refers to the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by microorganisms to decompose organic waste (Gu et. al, 2013). In contrast, COD refers to the amount of oxygen needed to chemically oxidize the organic compounds present (Cazaudehore et. al, 2019). \n",
        " \n",
        "The BOD test is typically conducted at wastewater plants, even though measuring organic content in this way is not very practical. The biggest drawback to the BOD test is that it does not provide immediate feedback about water quality. The standard BOD test is conducted over a 5 day period, and the results are not read until the 5 day. This wait makes BOD tests unsuitable for determining short term trends in water quality. Additionally, the BOD test itself is extremely labor intensive and time consuming. In contrast, the COD test is relatively easy to conduct, and the results can be determined within 3-4 hours. \n",

        "### Efficiency of UASB Reactors\n",
        "\n",
        "Some factors affecting the efficiency of UASB reactors are the temperature and pH. The ideal temperature for a UASB reactor should be around 35 °C (Ghaniyari-Benis et. al, 2009). Temperature affects the growth of microorganisms as well as BOD and COD removal (Abdelgadir et. al, 2014). For example, at 35 °C, bacteria can generate in 3 days. In 10°C, it can take up to 50 days for bacteria to generate (Escudie et. al, 2011). At 15 °C, COD removal can decrease to 50% from the optimal 70% (Khan et. al, 2011). Additionally, methane production can be affected by the temperature of the wastewater effluent. Although methane is relatively insoluble (Henry's constant = 776 bar•L/mol), the lower the temperature, the higher the methane solubility and therefore an increase in energy loss (Shoener et al,. 2014). Moreover, the optimal pH for microbial growth is 6.8 - 7.2 and low pH can inhibit methanogenesis (Latif et. al, 2011). The pH inside the granules can also affect the rate of substrate conversion (Saravanan et. al, 2006). Additionally, the structure of the granules can affect the efficiency of the UASB. Some models include the multi-layer model (Figure 20), syntrophic microcolony model, non-layered structure model, and granule cluster structure (Figure 21).\n",

        "### Biogas Production Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "The UASB reactor heavily relies on microorganisms to anaerobically breakdown organic matter in wastewater, a byproduct of which is biogas, more specifically, methane and carbon dioxide. As mentioned previously, biogas can be used as fuel for common household uses. Due to its reliance on live microorganisms, many factors and parameters contribute to the health of sludge granules, and therefore their production of biogas. These factors can also affect the cost and the efficiency of each reactor, and for the goals of supplying developing communities with wastewater treatment, it is best to keep costs low and the reactor efficient to ensure that the reactors are economically viable. Some parameters include, but are not limited to, pH, temperature, and hydraulic retention rate (Yadvika et al, 2004).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to additives, there are many operational parameters that can affect biogas production. One of the most important parameters being temperature. There are different ranges of temperature for anaerobic fermentation: psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic, each of which ranges from less than 30˚C, between 30˚C to 40˚C, and between 50˚C to 60˚C (Yadvika et al, 2004). The optimum temperature range (based on many studies) for an anaerobic digester is the mesophilic range. It is also favorable to construct reactors facing the sun to prevent drastic temperature drops (Yadvika et al, 2004).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important parameter is pH. pH can vary a lot due to the biogas that microbes produce. The desired range for pH is 6.8 – 7.2, and fatty acid concentration should be less than 2000 mg/L (Yadvika et al, 2004). It was also found that biomethanation at pH 5.0 and 4.0 was 67% and 34% respectively relative to production at pH 7.0 (Jain et al, 1998). These findings indicate keeping these microbes in an optimal pH environment is crucial for biogas production.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hydraulic retention times (HRT) can also affect biogas production. Shorter retention times increases the risk of active bacteria leaving during the washout period, and longer retention times carry a larger financial burden, as it requires larger volume to support the same flow rate (Yadvika et al, 2004). Driven by the lower economic costs, researchers have tried to reduce HRT without compromising the production of biogas. It was found that the optimum period was 16 to 20 days (Yadvika et al, 2004).\n",
        "\n",
        "There have also been studies on how different additives like powdered leaves stimulate the production of biogas. A study of the effect of the addition of tomato-plant wastes to rabbit waste improved methane production by over 40%, given the same proportions of waste, for several hydraulic retention rates (Trujillo et al, 1993). These additives are economically feasible and produce great results, as seen by the much higher efficiency in biogas production. "

        "### Ammonia Removal with Ammamox\n",
        "In current processes of removing ammonia and methane from the wastewater, there are a lot of methane emissions. Methane has a much greater global warming potential, 34 times that of carbon dioxide (IPCC, 2013). Due to this significant release of methane, wastewater treatment plants have a significantly higher carbon footprint than they would otherwise have (Daelman et al., 2014, Daelman et al., 2013).\n",
        "\n",
        "There have been attempts to curb this issue with minimal results thus far. One proposed solution was to couple denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) organisms with Anammox. The pairing of these two processes would use methane and remove nitrogen (Chen et al., 2014, Shi et al., 2013). Annamox bacteria and DAMO organisms have slow growth rates (Jetten et al., 1997, Strous et al., 1998)(Ettwig et al., 2009, Kampman et al., 2012), so they are well paired with each other. One attempt to solve this problem was by Shi et al. (2013). They  developed an Anammox-DAMO biofilm in a biofilm reactor. The issue with their design was that in order to convert ammonium to nitrate it requires partial nitritation, but the dissolved methane would be stripped during aeration. Winkler et al. (2015) also came up with a design that would use Anammox bacteria and DAMO bacteria in a granular sludge reactor. Once again though, the partial nitration step coming before this would strip the methane.\n",
        "\n",
        "The design proposed by Xueming et al. (2015) is a membrane biofilm reactor which combines partial nitritation-Anammox and DAMO processes to remove ammonia and methane from the anaerobic digestion where oxygen is added. The study used total nitrogen and methane not methane and ammonia. The study found that after the simultaneous ammonium and dissolved methane removal from the anaerobic digestion liquor was able to remove ammonium, total nitrogen, and dissolved methane with efficiencies up to 99.5% for ammonia, 95.9%for nitrogen, and 93.4% for methane.\n",
        "\n",
        " Influent surface loading, oxygen surface loading, and biofilm thickness also have an impact on removal efficiency (Xueming et al. 2015). There are optimal values of each that will produce better results in gas removal. Biofilm thickness should be around 750um for optimal gas removal (Xueming et al. 2015). By adjusting the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and oxygen surface loading and keeping the biofilm thickness around 750um the removal efficiencies of methane can reach up to 98% and nitrogen removal can reach up to 96%. This information can be used to gain insight on simultaneously removing ammonia and methane (Xueming et al. 2015).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulation by Xueming et al. (2015) was a small-scale replication of a real facility. The volume used was 1m^3 and the biofilm surface area of the reactor is 0.96m^3. Although this is a relatively small simulation compared to actual wastewater treatment plants, it is larger than the membrane reactor in Dr.Richardson’s lab. Something to consider when or if applying this study to the membrane reactor is that the simulation had a HRT of 4-8days which is a lot longer than the current membrane reactor’s HRT.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulation by Xueming et al. (2015) also focused on nitrogen and methane so the projections of this study onto methane and ammonium are not confirmed at this time. It may not be feasible to measure biofilm thickness on the membrane reactor in the lab but it is possibly something that could be checked on in the small reactor in Dr.Richardson's lab and be modified in the future.\n"

        "UASB also worked on biogas production. The team wrote code to estimate COD concentration of influent, the temperature of the reactor, and biogas production rate based on the flow rate through the reactor. The team decided on a gas bag system to store biogas and also wrote code to determine the required volume and dimensions for the lid of the biogas system. The team looked into removal of fats, oils and greases (FOG) and developed a design for the pilot UASB reactor's sludge sampling and removal system. Lastly, the team wrote code to calculate the optimal size of the pilot UASB reactor's tube settler, the number of plates required, and the overall height of the settling arm.\n",

To test the volume of biogas formed, a wet test meter was used; however, due to loose flanges, there were failures in the gas collection system of the UASB. To measure efficiency, the biogas went through gas chromatography tests to determine the composition of nitrogen, oxygen, and methane. The data revealed that no methane is found. From ammonia testing via color change and absorbance analysis, the change in ammonia concentration was almost the same after running the influent and effluent sourced from the IAWWTF. Subsequently, the team used membrane biofilm reactors to collect wastewater into a bag to trap gases. Only a permeable tube permitted the entry of oxygen to remove ammonia and dissolved methane. However, this test resulted in a significant amount of ammonia remaining in the effluent while having a loss of ammonium from the influent."

After the samples were prepared on a microplate, salicylate reagent, base solution, and hypochlorite reagent were mixed into each sample, which resulted in chemical reactions that led to the samples to change color. The color change was dependent on the ammonia levels present in the sample. Duplicates were made each time to ensure that the readings were precise. The TECAN machine was then used to measure the absorbance of the colors. The absorbance was translated into ammonia concentration by the machine’s corresponding software (Magellan V 7.1).\n",

According to this data, the concentration of ammonium is increasing as the wastewater progresses through treatment. However, this data is not reflective of the ammonium concentration in fresh wastewater. The influent and effluent samples were stored for over a week before the ammonium assay occured. During this time, the ammonium could have been decomposed by the microbes in the water, resulting in the decrease in ammonium concentration. The actual concentration of ammonium in both the influent and effluent of UASB should be much higher. Since the effluent of the membrane reactor was collected within less than an hour of testing, the concentration is reflective of the actual ammonium concentration in the sample. An ammonium concentration of 1.71 mg N/L is quite low, which shows that the membrane reactor is removing ammonium.\n",

The graph shows consistency for the most part with the ammonium concentrations for the UASB influent, UASB effluent, and BioFilm Membrane Reactor being similar. Figure 30 also shows the the membrane reactor was not removing but adding ammonium to the influent in the beginning, which could have been the effects of many factors. One factor being that protein degradation results in the release of amine groups, which can reactor with other molecules in the influent to make ammonium. As the wastewater sits for longer periods of time, protein degradation is more likely to happen. Another reason could have been due to the fact that the membrane reactor took a bit of time to adjust when it was initially turned on. Further testing is needed. \n",

        "## Conclusions\n",
        "The team has learned that the aforementioned methods are quite successful in reducing O2 and achieving an ideal ammonium concentration in influent and effluent samples. The next steps of action for the team is to reduce sources of error, including sample collection methods. For instance, in gas chromatography, the goal is to minimize the amount of room air that can interfere with the biogas sample. For collecting samples from the reactor, clean tanks must be used for accurate results as proven by the COD assay results. The team’s findings for this term indicate that the tests for wastewater are effective, so the team will continue to investigate the testing procedures but with a more frequent, consistent routine with new samples freshly sourced from the IAWWTF."

        "## Future Work\n",
        "Now that the prototype membrane reactor is up and running the team is going to be working on a membrane reactor with a 20L capacity. The first step is going to be calculating the surface area needed on the reactor tubing and fitting and sealing the head unit on the reactor. The plan is to use bike tubing for the permeation tubing as it is more accessible than specific lab tubing. Another thing to consider is that currently the prototype reactor is wrapped in tin foil to prevent sunlight from reaching the fluid in the reactor and causing unwanted growth that would not typically occur when the membrane reactor is actually in use. The vesicle that is going to be used for the upscale is opaque and will likely let in less light, but it may still be necessary to lessen the light input even more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing that is in the future works is increased COD testing. COD testing has been done once thus far this semester and the plan is to up this to once every 2-4 weeks in order to keep evaluating the state of the reactor and tweak things as needed. Continuing COD testing, ammonium testing, and gas chromatography will be increasingly important as the large scale membrane reactor is set up in order to ensure it is working like the prototype and how it should work.\n",

        "\n",
        "Finally, continuing the work from previous semesters in sealing the UASB at the IWWTP so that gas can be collected is going to be a focus.\n"
