## Abstract
The Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) team focuses on designing pilot scale UASB systems for primary wastewater treatment in Honduras.  This manual details our complete design process, including each component system of the UASB and how we decided on the final design.  This semester, we have focused on finishing our design process, so that fabrication can take place over Summer 2018.

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Zac Edit - Briefly outline the previous work done by the UASB team up until the Phase I grant, then focus on the design work done last semester.

Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)
