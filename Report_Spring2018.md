## Abstract
The Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) team focuses on designing pilot scale UASB systems for primary wastewater treatment in Honduras.  This manual details our complete design process, including each component system of the UASB and how we decided on the final design.  This semester, we have focused on finishing our design process, so that fabrication can take place over Summer 2018.

## Introduction

Direct discharge of human wastewater into the environment causes severe contamination of ground and surface water sources, leading to many adverse effects on the environment and human health.  Biological degradation of organic wastes by aerobic microbes depletes dissolved oxygen within natural water systems, harming aquatic life and creating dead zones.  Discharging wastewater also increases the waterborne fecal matter content, increasing the risk of human exposure to pathogens. [(Chong et. al. 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135412002400).  The latter is of particular concern for communities in the Global South, as populations downstream of wastewater outfalls suffer from severely degraded and dangerous drinking water as a result.  

Wastewater treatment can also be used for energy production.  Anaerobic digestion of organic matter produces biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide that can be combusted for energy production.  Recent estimates have shown that wastewater can contain over ten times the amount of energy needed to break it down [(Ghoneim et al., 2016)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7577509/?reload=true).  Most wastewater treatment plants in the US use purely aerobic treatment and thus to not take advantage of this opportunity [(Ghoneim et al., 2016)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7577509/?reload=true).  

Many communities in the Global South lack large scale wastewater treatment infrastructure like that of the United States, leaving much of their waste untreated.  Municipal treatment systems in the United States have long retention times, require large land areas, and have a high fixed cost per capita, making them inaccessible for much of the Global South [(Chong et. al. 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135412002400).  Our research and design have been focused on alleviating these problems by creating small-scale wastewater treatment systems, aimed at providing access for smaller rural communities.

Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors are used for primary treatment of wastewater by removing suspended solids and reducing organic matter.  UASB reactors use gravity to move water through the reactor, where anaerobic microbes treat the wastewater biologically and produce biogas.  This is a far less energy intensive process than the aerobic treatment incorporated within most large scale wastewater systems in the US, and can produce net energy through the biogas released in the system.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Zac Edit - Briefly outline the previous work done by the UASB team up until the Phase I grant, then focus on the design work done last semester.

Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)
