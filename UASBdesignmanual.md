Assuming a pulse volume input of 10-20 L, we plan to use a 5-gallon bucket that will be mounted off-centered on some sort of shaft. The bucket can rotate about the shaft, and this entire setup will be enclosed within a holding tank.

Monroe and the team came up with a couple of design choices for the tipping bucket:

1. Weld two blocks of PVC to the sides of the 5-gallon bucket. Drill a rod into each block without penetrating the bucket. These rods are used to mount the bucket at a certain height inside the holding tank.

   * **Pros**: Requires fewer materials. Is easier to fabricate.
   * **Cons**: Will need to align both rods perfectly. The welded sections will experience considerable shear. Replacing the bucket will be challenging.

2. Drill two holes in the bucket at an off-centered axis. Attach two screws to the bucket through these holes and use the screws to mount the bucket in the holding tank.

* **Pros**: Less shearing.
* **Cons**: Drilling holes makes the bucket vulnerable to leaks. Ease of replacement is still an issue.

3. Weld two brackets onto the inner wall of the holding tank. Put a hose clamp around the bucket and mount the bucket via the clamp onto two small rollers. These rollers are placed in two
