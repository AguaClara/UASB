## Introduction

This document serves to detail the entire design process of the UASB system.  While each semester the team has worked on differing parts of the reactor, and solved different problems within, this document will collect all of these decisions into one place so that future readers can understand the design process of the UASB.  As such, this is a working document and will continuously be edited as designs are changed and new ideas are introduced.

## Reactor Tank

Initial design of the UASB models the 1 L/s plant closely, and thus assumed the use of a 3" diameter PVC pipe for the base of the tank, as the design required a bend in the pipe for the plate settlers.  Since the UASB system requires no bends and is completely vertical, it was proposed to use a prefabricated plastic tank instead.  

The advantages of the prefabricated tank include:
* Lower overall costs
* Easier fabrication of bottom and top of tank (tank is already sealed)
* Higher structural stability (particularly at bottom of tank)
* Possible prefabrication of inlet and outlet system

The disadvantages include:
* Tanks are harder to source outside of the US and might require shipping in
* Since tanks are prefabricated, it becomes challenging to fabricate pieces inside the tank (which are more easily accessible in a PVC pipe)
* Most prefab tanks are made of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) rather than PVC.  Will require additional costs for welding rod and other materials.

The other design parameters are listed in the table below:
| Parameter | Value | Constraint                                                                            |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Height    | ~7ft  | Max height to still fit within lab space.  Could change based on fabrication location |
| Diameter  | 3ft   | No constraint. Chosen based on 1 L/s design   |

Precursory searches across Honduran suppliers found tanks of similar dimensions in HDPE, easing that concern.  Given that, it was decided to move forward purchasing a HDPE tank and using that for the initial design.  After local testing, the team will reevaluate the design based on materials available in Honduras and make any necessary changes.

The current plan is to purchase an HDPE tank similar to [this](https://www.plastic-mart.com/product/17049/300-gallon-plastic-tank-rotoplas-590314-590315) for fabrication of the first reactor.  After determining the location this system will be fabricated in, a final decision will be made on the dimensions of the tank and the tank will be purchased in preparation for fabrication in Fall 2018.

## Influent System

Assuming a pulse volume input of 10-20 L, we plan to use a 5-gallon bucket that will be mounted off-centered on some sort of shaft. The bucket can rotate about the shaft, and this entire setup will be enclosed within a holding tank.

Monroe and the team came up with a couple of design choices for the tipping bucket:

1. Weld two blocks of PVC to the sides of the 5-gallon bucket. Drill a rod into each block without penetrating the bucket. These rods are used to mount the bucket at a certain height inside the holding tank.

   * **Pros**: Requires fewer materials. Is easier to fabricate.
   * **Cons**: Will need to align both rods perfectly. The welded sections will experience considerable shear. Replacing the bucket will be challenging.

2. Drill two holes in the bucket at an off-centered axis. Attach two screws to the bucket through these holes and use the screws to mount the bucket in the holding tank.

**(Insert design drawing here)**

* **Pros**: Less shearing.
* **Cons**: Drilling holes makes the bucket vulnerable to leaks. Ease of replacement is still an issue.

3. Weld two brackets onto the inner wall of the holding tank. Put a hose clamp around the bucket and mount the bucket via the clamp onto two small rollers. These rollers are placed in two
